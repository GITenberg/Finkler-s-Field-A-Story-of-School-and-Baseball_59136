<small>ON THE BENCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“One out; men on first and third!”</p>

<p>The coach hit a swift grounder
toward second, and second baseman,
reaching it with one hand, snapped it
quickly to first, from whence, it sped back to
the plate and the outstretched glove of Dolph
Jones, catcher and captain of the Maple Ridge
School Nine.</p>

<p>It was snappy work all around. Tom Shay,
the coach, nodded approval, and the boys
grouped on the bench and along the top of the
stone wall behind it voiced applause.</p>

<p>Sam Phillips, who had been pitching to
“Ducky Drake,” the substitute catcher, pulled
off his glove and squeezed himself into a seat
on the bench. “Gus is playing good ball this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
spring, isn’t he?” he observed, his gaze on the
second baseman. “I guess, though, he is still
wondering how that ball got into his mitt!”</p>

<p>“Chesty” Harris, the manager, stopped
snapping the elastic on his score-book and
smiled. “Turnbull won’t have everything his
own way, Sammy. Steve Grady is going to
push him hard for second.”</p>

<p>“Steve’s not so bad,” answered Sam gravely.
“The only trouble with Steve is that he’s a
Towner.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Harris gave the elastic band an indignant
snap. “You wait until next Saturday
and see what the Towners will do to you
chaps!” Sam simulated surprise.</p>

<p>“Say, you’re a Towner, too, aren’t you,
Chesty? My word, I’d forgotten that! You
seem such a smart, decent sort of chap that
one sort of forgets your—your degradation!”</p>

<p>A murmur of laughter greeted this sally.
Repartee not being the baseball manager’s
strong point, he retorted by digging his elbow
forcibly into Sam’s ribs.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, but you wait and see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
way we’ll do you Boarders up! We’ve got the
dandy team this year, all right! Turnbull on
second, Mort Prince to pitch, Coolidge at
short——”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to play?” asked Sam
innocently.</p>

<p>“Oh, you run away,” muttered Chesty, amid
laughter. Harris’s efforts to make the team
and his final acceptance of the managership,
proffered him as a combined reward for his
efforts and consolation prize, was a school joke.
Chesty was good-natured and could stand any
amount of “ragging.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to hammer you all over the
lot,” announced one of the boys on the wall,
also a Towner, as the day students at Maple
Ridge were called.</p>

<p>“Pound away, Joe,” replied Sam with a
laugh. “I’ll give you a quarter apiece for all
the hits you make off me, my lad.”</p>

<p>“Give me a quarter for every time I get my
base?” asked Joe Williams eagerly.</p>

<p>“I will not! You’d get in front of the ball
and get hit! I know you, Joseph!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Ensued a spirited discussion of the chances
of Boarders and Towners to win the annual
baseball game which was to be played the following
Saturday. As many of the group were
Towners, the latter had the better of the argument,
however the contest might turn out.</p>

<p>It was half-past four of an afternoon in the
latter part of April. The fellows had been back
from Spring Recess but three days, and today’s
practice represented the first real work
that had been done out of doors since the autumn.
The first choice men were on the diamond,
and the dozen or so adorning the bench
and the stone wall were substitutes, if we except
Sam Phillips. Sam, a thickset, jolly-looking
youth of sixteen, was very little like the popular
conception of a good ball-player. But in
spite of his appearance, Sam was, in his way, a
wonder. He was the best pitcher that Maple
Ridge had ever known; what Coach Shay
called “a natural-born twirler.” It had been
Sam’s effective and heady work that had
wrested the victory from Maple Ridge’s dearly
hated rival, Chase Academy, last year, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
when the Towners talked glibly of winning Saturday’s
game they knew all the while that as
long as Sam Phillips was in the box for the
Boarders their chance of a victory was about
as big as an under-sized pea.</p>

<p>Maple Ridge School lies a mile and a half
from the town of Charlemont, Massachusetts.
The campus overlooks a wide valley of farm
and meadow pricked out with white homesteads,
with the river trailing like a blue ribbon down
the centre. Southward the smoky haze shows
where Springfield lies. Back of the school
property rises the steep slope of Maple Ridge.
The buildings are five in number; the two dormitories,
North and South; the recitation hall,
or School Building as it is called; the Residence,
abode of the Principal, Doctor Benedict—more
familiarly known as “Benny”—and the
gymnasium. Behind the gymnasium the land
slopes to a terrace wide enough to accommodate
two tennis courts. Another slope brings one
to the level of the playground. Not very extensive,
this latter; not half large enough for
its purpose, in fact, for behind the campus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Finkler’s meadow juts in, cutting the playground
down to a width scarcely more than
half of that of the campus itself. The restrictions
of the athletic field had long been a matter
for dissatisfaction amongst the students of
Maple Ridge. There wasn’t room for a running-track,
the gridiron filled almost every foot
of field, and as a baseball ground the place was
decidedly unsatisfactory, since a very long hit
to right field invariably went over the stone
wall into Finkler’s meadow, necessitating a
ground rule to the effect that over the wall
was good for but two bases. The eastward
limit of the school property was marked by the
brook that meandered between the edge of the
playground and the first slope of the Ridge.
On the other or northern side the playground
was limited by a high iron fence backed with
an evergreen hedge. Beyond lay the big estate
of one of Charlemont’s wealthiest mill owners.
As seeking to recover a ball knocked into Caldwell
grounds would have been an almost hopeless
effort, the diamond had been slightly
skewed until the foul-line on that side ran clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to the brook. But by securing a clear left field
it had been necessary to sacrifice right field,
and as a result the foul-line past first ended
abruptly against Farmer Finkler’s stone wall
but a short distance behind the bag, and during
a game one or more Preparatory Class
youngsters were posted nearby for the sole purpose
of jumping or scrambling over the wall
and recovering balls. The wall was well built,
but no wall erected without mortar can withstand
such constant assaults and, as may be
supposed, Farmer Finkler’s wall, in spring and
fall, was always in need of repairing. As a
matter of fact, no Maple Ridge boy bothered
his head much when in getting over he toppled
a stone to the ground, for between the owner
of the meadow and the students existed a feud
of long standing.</p>

<p>“Two down and a man on first!” shouted the
coach, tossing the ball and swinging his bat.
There was a <em>crack</em> and away arched the sphere.
But Mr. Shay had put too much swing into that
hit, for the ball came to earth in Finkler’s
meadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let it go!” he shouted, as Dolph Jones
tossed another ball to him. “Same play!”</p>

<p>This time the long fly was caught by Watkins
and relayed to the plate in time to cut off the
supposititious runner. Meanwhile “Midget”
Green, a “Prep” of twelve years, whose chief
ambition outside of school hours was to chase
balls, was scrambling over the wall. “Chesty”
Harris watched morosely.</p>

<p>“Gee,” he muttered, “I wish we had a field
big enough to play ball in!”</p>

<p>There was nothing novel in this complaint,
and so the hearers made no reply, unless a
grunt by “Ducky” Drake could be called such.
Every one heartily seconded Chesty’s wish, but
they did so silently. Concurrence was a matter
of course, just as protest every time a ball went
over the stone wall was a matter of habit.</p>

<p>“I should think they’d move this fence back
and give us more room.” This expression of
opinion, uttered in a quiet, serious voice, came
from a boy sitting on Sam’s left, a good-looking,
well-built fellow of fifteen who had hitherto
listened to the conversation in silence. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
looks of surprise directed toward him faded as
the others recognized the speaker.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Joe Williams, “it’s ‘Kansas.’”</p>

<p>A smile went around, and the boy who had
spoken echoed it faintly. “Well, now, couldn’t
they?” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure!” replied Chesty with a wealth of
sarcasm.</p>

<p>But Sam answered seriously.</p>

<p>“Jack,” he said, “if that stone wall could
be moved it wouldn’t be where it is. Benny
has been trying to buy or lease that piece of
meadow from old Finkler for years, but the
cranky old hayseed won’t listen to him. The
fact of the matter is, Jack, that old Fink doesn’t
like us; hates us like pizen, to be strictly truthful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, does he? Why?”</p>

<p>“We-ell—” Sam squinted thoughtfully across
the diamond—“I dare say we—that is, former
generations of Maple Ridgers—have worried
him some. By turning your head slightly, Mr.
Borden, you will observe that up the slope
there, behind South, there are trees. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Fall those trees bear apples, very, very enticing
apples, eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Rather!”</p>

<p>“Yum, yum!”</p>

<p>“The best ever, Sammy.”</p>

<p>“Quite so; and you ought to know, Joseph,”
Williams grinned. “Well, Jack, to err is
human, and every fall we err; I might say we
fall. I’m told that we used to err more than
we do now. One year, so history hath it, about
sixty fellows descended on that orchard between
morning school and dinner time and just
about—er—depopulated it of apples. Nowadays
the old codger keeps a dog, a large, ferocious
and extremely suspicious dog; his name
is Rowdy, and he is well named. Rowdy spends
all his waking moments—and I am convinced
that he never, never really sleeps—in prowling
around looking for Maple Ridge legs. Gathering
Farmer Finkler’s apples is no longer the
pleasant, casual recreation it used to be. If
your soul cries for apples now you put on all
your old clothes, bundle up your legs in leg-guards,
arm yourself with a baseball bat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
say your prayers as you creep silently over the
wall.” Sam shook his head regretfully. “No,
erring isn’t what it used to be. You have to
<em>work</em> for your apples these days!”</p>

<p>“They’re good, though, when you get them,”
sighed Chesty with a reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, but ever since Tyler Wicks spent almost
two hours up a tree with Rowdy underneath
begging him to come down and be
eaten my appetite for apples isn’t what it used
to was.” Sam frowned. “Personally, I think
it’s a mighty mean trick to let a dog hang
around an apple orchard. It—it indicates a
lack of confidence in the—er—the integrity of
your neighbors.”</p>

<p>“Very small, I call it,” Joe Williams agreed
laughingly.</p>

<p>“It seems too bad, though, he won’t let the
school have the use of that piece of land,” said
Jack Borden, turning to look at the clear, level
stretch of meadow beyond the wall. “It would
surely make a dandy field, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Fine <em>and</em> dandy, Kansas,” agreed Chesty.
“Why, if we had that, or even a good slice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
off it, we could have a quarter-mile running
track!”</p>

<p>“And then, maybe,” muttered Drake, who
was a member of the Track Team, “we wouldn’t
get simply snowed under every spring at the
Tri-Meet.”</p>

<p>“Considering we haven’t a track of our
own,” said Williams, “I think it’s sort of wonderful
we do as well as we do.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” Drake admitted. “But it
gets monotonous when you’re licked hard every
year. We go over to Chase or Dixon and get
ten or twelve points in field events and then
sort of stand around and watch the other fellows
take all the track stunts. It makes me
tired!”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” mused Chesty, “Old Fink will up
and shuffle off this mortal coil some day and
then we can have the field.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Don’t you believe it,” exclaimed
Williams pessimistically. “He will leave a will
forbidding his—whatdoyoucallems—his heirs to
let us have it. He’s the meanest old rascal in
the State of Massachusetts!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“And he hates us fellows like the mischief,”
added Drake.</p>

<p>“Hates us <em>for</em> the mischief, I guess,” laughed
Sam. “I don’t think he needs to be so nasty
about it, but I will own that he has some cause
for not loving us.”</p>

<p>“We never did anything to him until he acted
so pesky mean,” growled Williams. “Nothing,
that is, but swipe a few of his old apples. And
he’s got about a hundred trees over there and
wouldn’t miss what we take, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how it started,” replied
Sam, “but I do know that it’s war to the knife
now. Remember last Fall when we met him
coming home from town in his buggy and Tyler
Wicks walked up to the old horse and put his
arms around his neck?”</p>

<p>“You bet! Say, that <em>was</em> funny, wasn’t it?
The horse stopped short in the road and Old
Fink was so astonished he didn’t know what
to do or say for a minute!”</p>

<p>“And all the time Tyler was telling the horse
that he was a ‘nice old plug’ and why didn’t he
get a good, kind master.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“But when Old Fink woke up he had a few
things to say, didn’t he?” laughed Chesty.</p>

<p>“And the way he lashed out with his old
busted whip was a caution! He got Tyler
around the legs all right; he showed me the
welts next day.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said Joe Williams, “he
didn’t have any right to say we burned his
haycock last September.”</p>

<p>“No, and he will think we did it as long as
he lives. Nothing Benny could say made any
difference with him.”</p>

<p>“Was it really burned?” asked Jack Borden.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it was burned all right,” answered
Sam, “but none of us fellows knew anything
about it. It was tramps, probably. We
might have a little fun with the old codger, and
swipe a few of his apples, but we don’t do
things like that, you know.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad he thinks that, though,” mused
Jack Borden. “It seems to me that if we
want to get the field we’d ought to be decent
to him.”</p>

<p>“Huh! It’s too late for that now,” responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Drake gloomily. “He thinks we’re a
pack of thieves and pirates.”</p>

<p>“Still, if we told him we wouldn’t make any
more trouble or take any more apples——”
suggested Jack.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t believe it,” Chesty laughed.
“You might drop around and see him some day,
Borden, and tell him that. Just mention my
name and it will be all right.”</p>

<p>“And if you get a chance at that fool dog,”
said Williams, “just give him a kick for me,
will you?”</p>

<p>“And another for me,” added Drake.</p>

<p>Jack was silent for a moment, looking
thoughtfully at the meadow over his shoulder.
Finally:</p>

<p>“Just the same,” he said, “I have an idea
that Mr. Fink——”</p>

<p>“Finkler,” corrected Sam.</p>

<p>“Finkler might be brought around if we set
out to do it.” Jack smiled half apologetically.
“Of course, I don’t know very much about it,
fellows, but it looks to me like a situation demanding
diplomacy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sort of fancy yourself as a diplomat, Kansas?”
asked a boy on the wall. Jack shook his
head.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. But if you fellows really need
that field as badly as you say you do you’re
going the wrong way about it. I know that
much.”</p>

<p>“You know a whole lot for a new boy, seems
to me,” said Joe Williams irritably. “I suppose
out in Kansas——”</p>

<p>“Out in Kansas,” interrupted Jack calmly,
“we don’t punch a fellow’s head when we want
him to do us a favor.”</p>

<p>No one found anything to say to this, although
Williams growled something to his
neighbor regarding “fresh Western kids.”
And before the subject could be proceeded with
the Coach called the players in and turned
toward the bench.</p>

<p>“All ready now,” he said. “We’ll try a few
innings. Second Team in the field. Prince and
Drake, battery. Wales on third, Borden in left
field. Get out there and throw around, boys!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>“KANSAS”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jack Borden had made the mistake of
entering Maple Ridge in January at
the beginning of the Winter Term, for
the boy who enters school after his fellows seldom
quite catches up. By the time of his
arrival friendships have been formed, elections
have been held and the school has shaken itself
down, and the late arrival finds himself in the
position of a frog in a strange puddle. Jack
had meant to enter Maple Ridge in the autumn,
but events had prohibited. One stroke of luck
had, however, befallen him. Sam Phillips’s
room-mate, Storey, had been forced to give up
school because of illness, and Sam was in undisputed
possession of Number 12 South when
Jack arrived on the scene. Therefore Jack was
put in with Sam, an arrangement that didn’t
please Sam at all. At first Sam, like most
every other fellow at Maple Ridge, every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of whom hailed from the Eastern States, and
the most of them from New England, viewed
the Kansan with mingled curiosity and alarm.
Jack was the very first Westerner to invade
Maple Ridge, and his coming seemed revolutionary,
a veritable shattering of precedent.
There was absolutely no telling what wild and
gruesome things a Westerner might do!</p>

<p>It wasn’t snobbishness that caused Maple
Ridge to at first look askance at Jack. It was
rather a spirit of clannishness, due to the fact
the school was essentially New England, and
that in almost every case when a new student
entered the other fellows either knew him personally
or knew who he was. Very likely he
was fresh from one of the four or five lower
schools that fed Maple Ridge; quite possibly
he was the second or third or even fourth of
his name to enter. Jack was an outsider whom
nobody had ever heard of, who had attended no
school that anybody knew of and who, as though
to emphasize his oddity, came not only from a
place outside New England but from the West,
a region treated of in geographies and occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
briefly visited by adventurous youths,
but a region quite outside the philosophy of
Maple Ridge! And so at first Jack was accorded
an uneasy curiosity not unlike that
which might have been displayed toward an
Indian or a cowboy.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, as the Kansan neither
scalped Doctor Benedict, indulged in war-whoops
or behaved vastly different from themselves,
the others got over their alarm and
accepted the newcomer if not unreservedly at
least with toleration and a display of respect.
For a time the name of Kansas had been applied
to him, not at all in a sense of ridicule,
however, but that appellation was gradually being
dropped. In a manner Jack was, I fear,
something of a disappointment to his schoolmates.
They were quite prepared to be shocked
and scandalized by the Westerner, and when no
shocks were forthcoming they doubtless lost
much of their faith in the stories they had read
about the Wild West.</p>

<p>Sam Phillips held his new and undesired
room-mate at arms’ length for quite a week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Sam was the third of his line who had attended
Maple Ridge and he was thoroughly imbued
with the traditions of the school. That the
West should, as he slangily put it, “butt in”
there filled him with alarm and disgust. But
Jack, who had far more tact than is usually
possessed by a boy of his years, refused to
show that he was aware of the school’s doubts
and aloofness, went about his work and play
in a quiet, self-possessed manner and made no
overtures to any one, even Sam. He was never
fresh, didn’t talk about the West or Kansas
unless questioned, and accepted the customs and
manners of the school without the lifting of
an eyelash. In short, he showed himself to be
a thoroughly likeable chap, good-looking, wide-awake,
self-respecting, and not without a certain
half-serious sense of humor that made a big hit
with Sam. At the end of the week Sam capitulated
and, being a warm-hearted, good-natured
youth, his capitulation was thorough. At the
end of a fortnight the two were fast friends.
It was that fact that helped Jack with the rest
of the school. Sam vouched for him and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
went a long way, for Sam was more or less of
a school idol. You can’t pitch your school nine
to victory over its rival without being placed
on a pedestal, you see. If Sam liked Kansas
and said so, why, Kansas must be a pretty good
sort, after all. Doubtless the wild and woolly
West wasn’t so wild and woolly as it was
painted in the story books. Secretly Jack was
at first a trifle angry and later not a little
amused over the attitude of the school toward
him. But at no time did he lose either his
temper or his sense of humor; a fact which
proves him at the outset an extremely level-headed,
sensible chap!</p>

<p>After practice Jack and Sam returned together
to the gymnasium, pausing a moment on
the terrace to watch a game of tennis that was
in progress.</p>

<p>“How did you get on?” asked Sam as they
continued up the path.</p>

<p>“All right, I think,” replied Jack. “I only
had two chances in the field and got them both.”</p>

<p>“That’s good, but let me tell you something,
Jack. When you threw to the plate on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
short fly that time, you sent the ball to the right.
Never do that, my boy. Always put it to the
left of the plate; that is, your left. It’s better
to put it yards too far to the left than three
feet too far the other way. You’ve got to
consider the catcher, you see. It’s a heap easier
for him to step to his right for a throw-in than
to his left. Get that?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But the trouble is, Sam, that when
you’re in a hurry and you’ve got a long throw
you can’t always put the ball just where you
want it.”</p>

<p>“No, but the oftener you do the better chance
you stand of making the team. That’s the
point, Jack. Every fielder slips up sometimes,
but it’s the fellow that slips up oftenest that
sits on the bench when the real games come
along. When you throw in to the plate—which
isn’t very often, of course, since you’ll usually
throw to an infielder—just glue your eye to the
catcher’s left and put your mind on getting the
ball there. And, by the way, never take your
eye away from where the ball’s going until it’s
left your hand. Some fellows shift their eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
while they’re throwing, and those chaps are
never sure. We had a fellow on the team last
year named Crowder. Shay was trying him
at third. He was a hustling chap, all right,
and a good batter; could stop almost any ball
within ten feet of his position, too; and about
four times out of five he threw to first as
straight as a die; used to do some of the prettiest
throwing I ever saw. But when the fifth
time came along, why, the ball would go ten
feet to one side or the other or six feet over
first baseman’s head; and by the time the ball
was found the runner would be sitting on third!
Shay couldn’t make out what the trouble was
at first, but after awhile he found out. It
seemed that Crowder would get the ball, turn
and find first and then throw like the mischief,
and always as his arm shot out he’d turn his
head away. Ever play golf, Jack?”</p>

<p>Jack shook his head. “No, but I’ve seen it
played.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the same idea. You swing your
club back and you keep your eye right on the
back of the ball—or just behind it—until you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hit it; and then you keep on looking at it until
you’ve finished your stroke; and then you keep
on looking at it until it’s reached the ground
somewhere. You’re thinking two things. First,
you’re thinking that you’re going to bring the
head of your club square against the ball, and
you do it. Then you’re thinking that that ball
is going to travel in a certain direction and land
in a certain part of the course, and it does.
That’s where mind gets in its work, Jack. But
just try taking your eyes off that ball while
you’re making the stroke. Result is you hit
behind it, or you top it, or maybe you just
plumb miss it altogether. Same way with
throwing a baseball. Look where you want the
ball to land and then put your mind on it. I’d
make a peach of a pitcher if, every time I sent
a ball away, I looked over my shoulder, eh?”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean, of course,” replied
Jack as they entered the gymnasium. “I
hadn’t just thought of that before, though. I’m
much obliged.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” responded Sam as they
ran down the stairs to the locker room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
“You’ve got the making of a good player, I
think, Jack, and I want to see you get a place
on the team. You bat mighty well for a chap
who hasn’t played much, and if you can do a
little better at that and play a good, steady,
reliable game in the outfield, why, I don’t see
why Shay shouldn’t take you on. Anyhow, you
can be pretty sure of a place on the second
team, for you can bat all around Cook. Just
you buckle down for the next two weeks and
work hard, you wild Westerner, and you’ll
make good. Here, you, Ted Warner, move
along and make room for two gentlemen on that
bench!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Sammy. How’s the Arm?” (Sam’s
pitching arm was always referred to in a manner
of the deepest respect and reverence, and
its welfare was a matter of constant anxiety.
The word Arm as Ted Warner pronounced it
began with a capital A.)</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy,” replied Sam. “You
know Mr. Borden, don’t you, Ted?” Ted
shook hands with Jack.</p>

<p>“We’ve never been properly introduced yet,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
he answered smilingly, “but we’ve passed the
time on the field, I think. How are you getting
on, Borden?”</p>

<p>“He’s doing finely,” replied Sam, saving
Jack the trouble of answering. “We’re going
to have him on the first in a week or so.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, I’m sure,” said Ted politely. “I
say, Sammy, come over to the room tonight,
will you? We want to fix up a batting-list for
Saturday’s game with the Towners. Dolph told
me to tell you. Bring Borden along if he cares
to come.”</p>

<p>Ted slipped out of the last of his togs and,
wrapping a bath towel about him, nodded,
smiled and turned toward the showers.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said Sam with satisfaction.
“I’m glad he asked you over.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he and Dolph Jones room together,
you see, and Dolph’s captain, as you know. It
doesn’t do a fellow any harm to know the captain
if he wants to make the team.” Sam
grunted as he pulled his shirt over his head.
“Of course,” he went on as his head reappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to sight, “I don’t mean there’s any
favoritism here; only that, all other things being
equal, you know, being a friend of Dolph’s
might help a little. Even a baseball captain’s
human. See you later, Jack.”</p>

<p>Sam scurried toward the shower baths, leaving
his room-mate to finish his undressing leisurely
and thoughtfully. He was quite as anxious
to get on the baseball team as Sam was
to have him, but, he reflected with a rueful
smile, with all his inexperience behind him he
doubted if even a personal acquaintance with
Captain Dolph Jones would place him there.
Still, if hard work could do the trick——</p>

<p>He picked up his own towel, draped it about
him and strode across the locker room as resolutely
as though baseball practice and not a
hot and cold shower bath awaited him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>SAM IS MISSING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Number 4, North Dormitory, was a
revelation to Jack. The room he
shared with Sam Phillips in South
was comfortable enough and not at all
badly furnished, but Sam “didn’t go in
much for fancy gimcracks,” to use his own expression.
The room occupied by Ted Warner
and his chum Dolph Jones was carpeted with a
dark red Oriental rug, and all the furniture,
even the wide study desk in the middle, was of
black oak. Most of the chairs held leather
cushions that you sank into as softly as into a
feather bed. The drop-light was covered by a
big opal glass shade that threw the light downward
and left the upper part of the room in a
pleasant twilight, through which the dozens of
pictures and schoolboy trophies on the walls
peered dimly and interestingly to the callers.</p>

<p>Jack was properly introduced to Dolph Jones—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
ceremony he considered rather unnecessary,
since he and Dolph in the rôles of candidate and
captain had already spoken to each other on the
baseball diamond more than once—and then sat
comfortable and silent in one of the big leather
cushioned chairs while Dolph and Ted and Sam
drew up around the light and discussed the matter
of the batting order for Saturday’s game.
Both Dolph and Ted were seniors, and, save in
the matter of complexion, looked to Jack very
much alike. Later, however, he realized that the
resemblance was due more to the fact that they
were each of the same type than to any real
likeness of feature. Dolph was seventeen and
Ted Warner eighteen, but there was scarcely a
fraction of an inch difference in heights, and
each was tall, well-built and lean, with the leanness
of the boy who keeps himself in perfect
physical condition. Dolph was dark of hair
and eyes, while Ted was decidedly light, his
hair being pale brown and his eyes something
between blue and gray. On the nine Dolph,
who was captain, caught, and Ted played first
base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here’s the way; I had it fixed up,” Dolph
was saying, referring as he spoke to a paper in
his hand. “Truesdale, Jones, Grady, Warner,
Cook, Smythe, Cassart, Watkins and Phillips.
What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I’d have Harry Smythe bat first,” said
Sam. “He’s a heap better on the bases than
Truesdale.”</p>

<p>“He’s faster,” said Ted, “but he takes risks
at the wrong times. Truesdale can draw a pass
three times out of five, too. Then, with Dolph
up next he’s pretty sure of second on a sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Sam. “I see, though,
you’ve got Cook down for left field. Why don’t
you give Jack here a chance? He’s every bit
as good as Cook.”</p>

<p>Dolph glanced at Jack and hesitated. Ted
smiled, and then went to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Cook’s had more experience, Sammy, and
in a Boarders and Towners game it’s a good
idea to play fellows who have been through it
before. You see, Borden,” he added, turning
to Jack, “everything goes in these games, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
it isn’t so much science that wins as it is keeping
your head. When you go to bat you’ll
have thirty or forty idiots standing around and
yelling like Indians and doing everything they
can to rattle you. Still, Dolph, you might put
Borden in for part of the game. I dare say
it’s a good experience for a fellow. If Borden
can get through a Towner game without getting
rattled he can stand anything.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about me,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket,” said Sam. “Put Jack in
for the last four innings. You needn’t be afraid
of his getting scared. I’ve never seen anything
feaze him yet. He’s just about as nervous
and fidgety as a granite post!”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Dolph, making a memoranda
on the sheet of paper. “Borden goes in
in the fifth. Heard anything, Sammy?”</p>

<p>“No, but something’s up; I’m dead sure of
that. Gus goes around grinning like a catfish
all the time and Tyler smirks every time he
looks at me. I wonder what sort of a caper
they’re up to this time. Last year,” he went
on for Jack’s benefit, “they got a chap named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Riley from somewhere and palmed him off as a
Towner. At least, that’s what they tried to do,
but, of course, we got onto the dodge in a
minute.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dolph dryly, “we got onto it
after he’d knocked out a three-bagger in the
first inning and scored two runs!”</p>

<p>“I never even looked at him until he got to
third,” said Sammy ruefully, “and I guess you
didn’t, Dolph.”</p>

<p>“Well, he puzzled me when he went to bat,”
answered Dolph. “I thought I knew all the
fellows in school, but that chap was a total
stranger. So, as there were two men on bases,
I signaled you to try him with a high one,
thinking he’d fan. Instead of that he reached
up and got it and sent it over left fielder’s
head.”</p>

<p>“And pretty near won the game, too,” added
Ted.</p>

<p>“What did you do to him?” asked Jack interestedly.</p>

<p>“Ran him off the field,” replied Dolph grimly.
“The umpire called time and we had a ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
minute riot. The last we saw of Riley, though,
he was streaking it for town.”</p>

<p>“One year,” said Sam, “before any of us
fellows got here, they moved the first and second
bags about four feet nearer each other than
they should have been, and the Boarders wondered
why almost every Towner that reached
first got to second ahead of the throw!”</p>

<p>“It must be a funny sort of a game,” laughed
Jack.</p>

<p>“It is,” Ted grinned reminiscently. “Remember
last year, Sammy, when they had men
on second and third and needed two runs to tie
the score? And Wicks stood alongside Dolph
and every time you pitched a ball he yelled
‘<em>Drop it</em>’?”</p>

<p>“I remember it,” growled Dolph. “I didn’t
mind it at first, but after awhile I got so rattled
I didn’t know where I was.”</p>

<p>“And when the ball did get by you finally
you couldn’t find it,” laughed Ted.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t find it! Of course, I couldn’t find
it! Some one kicked it into the crowd!”</p>

<p>“Did they score?” Jack asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Two runs. But we hammered the stuffing
out of the ball in the eighth inning and won.
What was the score, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Nine to six.”</p>

<p>“Nine to seven,” corrected Sam.</p>

<p>“Nine to six.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you.” Dolph pulled open a drawer
in the desk, took out a score book and found the
game. “Nine to seven, Ted.”</p>

<p>“I stand corrected, gentlemen. Anyway, it
was a peach of a game, all right. I hope we’ll
have as much fun this time. I suppose Mort
Prince will pitch for them.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t any one else that I know of,”
said Sam.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s pitching pretty good ball this
Spring so far,” said Dolph. “But I guess we’ll
have the better of the pitching argument with
you in the box.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got some good batters, though,”
replied Sam. “Gus Turnbull, Tyler Wicks, Dick
Furst; Prince himself isn’t so bad with the
ash.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of what they can do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the bat,” said Ted. “It’s their schemes for
breaking up the game that worry me. They’ll
probably spring something brand new on us
this time.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to do a little rough-housing
ourselves,” Sam smiled. “About ten
of the fellows will be there with tin horns and
a drum and a broken-winded cornet, and they
ought to make some sensation!”</p>

<p>“Bully!” laughed Ted. “Music will be rendered
by the Boarders’ Cornet Band!”</p>

<p>“Executed, you mean,” said Dolph. “Well,
then, this batting list is all right, you think?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Don’t see how we can better it,” remarked
Ted.</p>

<p>“Then I’m off for a line of study.” Sam
arose and Jack followed his example. “We’d
all better keep our ears wide open and our eyes
peeled between now and Saturday. If we can
find out what they’re up to maybe we can get
ready for them. I don’t half like the way Gus
is grinning!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a private detective on the job,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
answered Dolph. “Young Green, Midget
Green, you know, came to me this afternoon
and said he’d heard that the Towners were
going to do something this year that would just
give them the game. He didn’t know what it
was, however; he’d just heard some of the kids
boasting. I told him to try and find out what
the Towners were up to and he’s hot on the
trail now, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Ted, “you promised him
that if he found out anything you’d let him
chase balls in Finkler’s meadow for the rest of
his natural life!”</p>

<p>“Something of that sort,” agreed Dolph
smilingly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it possible to get hold of some of that
field?” asked Jack. “I heard the fellows talking
about it this afternoon, and Sam says Finkler
won’t sell or lease or anything.”</p>

<p>“Wish we could,” said Dolph. “No, the old
rascal has it in for us good and hard. It’s a
wonder he doesn’t stand down there with a
shotgun and keep us from getting the balls
that go over there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has he been asked about it lately?” pursued
Jack.</p>

<p>“Lately? Why, no, not for a year or so, I
suppose. I guess Benny’s tired of making him
offers. The last time he offered old Finkler
about twice what the land was worth, I heard.
What the school ought to do is to get some land
across the road and put the athletic field there.
We need a running track pretty bad, Borden.”</p>

<p>“So I should think. I was wondering
whether if the fellows sort of got together and
agreed not to—to worry Mr. Finkler, or to
trespass any more, he wouldn’t rent a strip of
that meadow to us.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know the old chap,” said Ted.
“He simply won’t listen to reason. I guess
we’d all be glad enough to let him alone if
he’d hand over enough of that meadow to give
us a decent athletic field.”</p>

<p>“Well, couldn’t we tell him that?” asked
Jack earnestly. “It wouldn’t do any harm to
try, would it?”</p>

<p>“N-no, but I don’t believe I’d care to be the
fellow to talk to him.” This from Dolph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, we couldn’t do anything,” protested
Sam. “Benny would have to make the offer.
And I guess Benny is tired of it by this time.
Never mind about old Finkler now, Jack; come
on home and put your nose in your books.”</p>

<p>Back in Number 12, South, Sam remarked as
he pulled his books toward him: “I’m glad
we worked Dolph to let you into the game,
Jack. There’s nothing like getting a start.
You can play just as well as Cook if you have
a little more experience.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad of the chance to play,” answered
Jack, “but I don’t like having to ask
for it.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Sam tried his fountain pen on his
thumb nail and then wiped his nail on his dark
hair. “Modesty’s all right, Jack, as long as
it don’t interfere with getting what you want.
All folks aren’t mind readers and sometimes
you’ve got to speak out.”</p>

<p>Having delivered this bit of philosophy Sam
leaned his elbows on the desk, got a firm grip
of his hair with each hand and plunged into
French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The weather began to warm up toward the
last of the week, and Saturday was like a day
in the middle of May. There are no “hours”
on Saturday at Maple Ridge except for the
Seniors, who have recitations from nine to half-past
ten. At eleven Dolph Jones got his
Boarders team together for an hour in order
that the reconstructed nine might get accustomed
to its new formation. The loss of Gus
Turnbull, Jim Curtis and Tyler Wicks, all
Towners, weakened the team not a little. The
Towners would not show up until just before
the time set for the game, two o’clock, and were
doubtless holding practice this morning at the
Fair Grounds. Although the Boarders had
done their best to discover what particular
brand of torture the enemy had invented for
the occasion they had learned nothing. Midget
Green, the amateur sleuth, had utterly failed
in his mission and was much cast down
thereby.</p>

<p>“We’ll just have to keep our eyes open,” said
Ted Warner as he and Dolph and some of the
others talked it over before practice. “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
we’ll make sure, too, that they don’t monkey
with the bases!”</p>

<p>Mr. Shay, the coach, not being on hand, Sam
and Harry Smythe, the shortstop, batted balls
for the fielding practice, Hal Morris, a substitute
pitcher, taking Smythe’s place in the infield.
Afterwards there was batting practice, Sam
pitching until just before twelve, when a message
called him away.</p>

<p>“It’s up to you, Hal,” said Dolph to Morris.
“You’d better let yourself out a bit. You may
have to go in for awhile this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Shortly after twelve the fellows went back
to the campus to get ready for dinner. Sam
wasn’t in the room when Jack got there, nor
did he return before dinner time. In the dining
hall Sam’s seat was empty when Jack went in
and remained so when the latter had finished
his meal. Jack, however, thought little of it;
doubtless Sam’s message accounted for his tardiness.
In the confusion succeeding dinner
Jack forgot all about his room-mate. With
others of the players he watched from the steps
of School Building the formation of the line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
march to the field. Leading the procession was
Pete Sawyer, a battered cornet in his hands.
Then followed the rest of the “band,” with a
decrepit snare-drum, several tin horns and
some assorted instruments of torture such as
watchmen’s rattles, accordions and mouth-organs.
A strip of unbleached muslin with the
inscription “Champions” lettered upon it in
fresh and sticky green paint was secured to
two poles and borne aloft. Old clothes were
the proper regalia, and many of the fellows
had added to the color and picturesqueness of
the occasion by turning their coats inside out,
while those who possessed any eccentric article
of apparel wore it. With a discordant riot of
sound from the “band” the procession, cheering
and capering, moved off to the field and the
players followed laughingly to the gymnasium.</p>

<p>While they were changing into baseball togs
a burst of noise summoned them to the windows.
The Towners had arrived. The nine
marched ahead, Ducky Drake leading the way
in the rôle of drum major, with a bat in lieu
of baton. Then came the non-combatants and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
their village friends, a good half-hundred boys
all together. They shouted and jeered at the
players at the open windows and passed down
the terrace path and out of sight.</p>

<p>“There’s quite a bunch of them, isn’t there?”
observed Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ted. “They bring their
friends, you see. Say, where’s Sammy? Isn’t
he here?”</p>

<p>Jack looked around and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him since he left the field.”</p>

<p>Ted stared.</p>

<p>“Well, some one must find him and tell him
to hurry up. Joe, you’re dressed. Run up to
South and find Sam. Tell him to hurry it up,
will you?”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t at dinner,” said Jack, “so maybe
he’s in hall now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Joe, if you don’t find him in his room
look in the dining hall, will you? Only tell him
to get a move on. What do you think of Sammy,
Dolph?” Ted continued as Joe Cassart sped
away on his errand. “What time does he think
the game begins, I wonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sam? Isn’t he here? Where is he? I
haven’t seen him since practice.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I. You don’t suppose——”
Ted stopped and stared incredulously at Dolph.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” answered the captain impatiently.
“He’s around somewhere. Come on,
fellows, and let’s go down.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ted remained uneasy, and so,
I suspect, did Dolph in spite of his seeming
confidence. Their appearance on the field was
the signal for a blare of music and cheering
from the Boarders and groans and cat-calls
from the enemy. The rival camps were on
opposite sides of the diamond. A few boys
were lolling in the grandstand, but the majority
clustered as near the foul lines as they could
get in order that their vocal and instrumental
efforts at enlivening the contest might have full
sway. The Towners were at practice and so the
Boarders passed balls until their turn came to
get on the diamond. Ted and Dolph kept an
anxious watch for Sam, but he didn’t appear,
nor was there any news of him. The Towners
finished their warming-up and yielded the field.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Dolph summoned Midget Green, who, as always,
was hovering as near his hero as he could
get, and whispered instructions in his ear.
Midget lit out for the campus, while many of
the Towners, guessing his errand, smiled
broadly.</p>

<p>The umpire was Mr. Shay, the coach, and at
two he called the Boarders in. Dolph won the
toss and selected the field.</p>

<p>“We’re not ready to start yet, though,” said
Dolph. “We’re waiting for Phillips. I’ve sent
for him.” He spoke confidently enough, although
his gaze wandered anxiously toward the
terrace path.</p>

<p>“It’s time to play,” said Morton Prince, captain
and pitcher of the Towners. “I insist, Mr.
Umpire, that the game begin.”</p>

<p>“We’ll wait five minutes,” responded Mr.
Shay.</p>

<p>Prince shrugged his shoulders and turned
away.</p>

<p>“They’ve bought the umpire, fellows,” he
announced with a laugh. “We might as well
go home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Shouts of “play ball!” came from the
Towners. At that minute Joe Cassart appeared
breathlessly and drew Dolph aside. It
was quite apparent that something had gone
wrong and both Towners and Boarders ceased
their shouting.</p>

<p>“I can’t find him anywhere, Dolph,” reported
Joe. “He isn’t in his room and he
hasn’t been in dining hall. I went to the Residence,
too; thought he might have been called
to see Benny; but Benny doesn’t know anything
about him. I looked everywhere.”</p>

<p>Dolph shrugged his shoulders hopelessly.</p>

<p>“They’ve got him,” he said. “They probably
sent a decoy message and Sammy walked
right into the trap. There’s no use looking for
him. We’ll just have to go ahead without him.
Hal, you’re in the box. Sam can’t be found.”</p>

<p>The news spread instantly and shouts of
anger arose from the Boarders. “Kidnappers!
Thieves! Let’s rush ’em!”</p>

<p>“None of that, fellows!” warned Dolph.
“We’re here to play ball and we’ll do it. And
we’ll lick ’em in spite of all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>These sentiments were greeted with a cheer,
a loud peal from the cornet and a frenzied beating
of the drum. Good nature was restored.
Dolph sent his team into the field just as Midget
Green put in an appearance.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t find him, please, Jones,” he stammered.
“I—I looked everywhere!”</p>

<p>“All right, Midget. Much obliged. We’re
going to beat them without Sam. You look
after foul balls, like a good chap.”</p>

<p>“I will,” Midget beamed and ran to his
position on the stone wall. Morris began to
pitch to Dolph, and Tyler Wicks, with bat in
hand, came across to the plate to start the game
for the Towners.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to pitch Sam?” he asked
innocently.</p>

<p>“You know mighty well we’re not,” growled
Dolph as he tossed the ball back to Morris.
“Where’d you put him?”</p>

<p>“Put him?” Tyler grinned maddeningly.
“Dolph, your suspicions wound me.”</p>

<p>“Do, eh? Well, you stand up here and see
what happens to you, my friend.” He stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
forward and launched the ball down to Grady
on second. “We’ll make you wish you hadn’t
been so smart before we’re through with you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Shay pulled his mask on and took up his
position behind Dolph.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” he cried.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>BOARDERS VS. TOWNERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hal Morris, as a pitcher, was not
in the same class with Sam Phillips,
nor was he nearly so good as Mort
Prince. He had speed and two or three
simple curve balls that weren’t very puzzling,
especially as almost every one of the Towners
had stood up to him in front of the
batting net and were well used to his pitching.
It was a foregone conclusion that the Towners
would hit Morris good and hard. If the Boarders
were to win the game it must be through
tight fielding and an equal dexterity with the
bat. Dolph, pretty sore over the trick that had
been sprung on him, determined grimly that his
team should win in spite of the handicap. And
for a time it really looked as though the Boarders
might come through victorious, for Morris,
working finely with Dolph, struck out Tyler
Wicks, amidst the cheers and jeers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Boarders; disposed of Ducky Drake in the same
manner, and threw Coolidge out at first.</p>

<p>“That’s good work, Hal,” said Dolph as they
retired to the bench. “Keep that up and we’ll
put it all over them.”</p>

<p>Truesdale worked Prince for a pass and got
to second on Dolph’s neat sacrifice hit to third.
But Grady was an easy out, shortstop to first,
and Ted Warner popped an infield fly to second
baseman. Again in the second inning Morris
held the enemy safely, and the opinion became
current that Morris was a better man on the
mound than he had been given credit for being,
and that Shay was making a mistake in not
using him more. With one out and men on first
and second, Morris himself started the double
play that retired the Towners.</p>

<p>But if Prince’s team was unable to score, so
too was Dolph’s. Up to the beginning of the
fourth inning the only hit that had been made
was of a scratch variety by Smythe, and neither
side had reached third base. So far the spectators
had remained in what, for a Towner-Boarder
game, was a very orderly condition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
But when Gus Turnbull found Morris for a two-bagger
right at the start of the fourth the
Towners’ enthusiasm began to bubble. And it
boiled over when Joe Williams followed with a
bunt that advanced Turnbull and left him safe
on first. Morris began to look worried and
Dolph strove to steady him down. But Morris
had never faced real trouble before, and with
the coachers trying their best to rattle him and
the Towners along the third base line ably seconding
their efforts, he began to lose control.
He pitched four balls to Peters and the bases
were filled. Boarders and Towners shouted
at the tops of their lungs, the latter trying to
get the rival nine “up in the air” and the
former doing their best to drown out their
enemies. Milton Wales was up and Dolph knew
that Milton was a weak batter. He signaled
for a straight ball “in the groove,” but Morris
pitched a wild one that Dolph just barely
stopped. At this sign of disintegration the
Towners, highly delighted, redoubled their
clamor.</p>

<p>“He’s up in a balloon! He’s up in a balloon!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
shouted the coachers. “He can’t put
’em over, Milt. You’ll walk, you’ll walk!”</p>

<p>And walk he did, for Morris, after registering
one strike and having two balls against him,
sent in a wild one that took Wales on the elbow,
giving him his base and forcing in the first run.</p>

<p>Towners cavorted and turned somersaults
on the turf, yelled and hooted. Dolph walked
down and had a whispered talk with Morris,
and that delighted the enemy even more.</p>

<p>“Talk it over, Dolph!” “No secrets there!”
“That’s right, old chap, change your signals!”</p>

<p>Ducky Drake, the Towners’ catcher, who followed
Wales, should have been an easy out.
And yet, in some mysterious manner, he managed
to connect with a straight ball and drop
it over second baseman’s head, scoring two
more runs. Pandemonium broke loose then.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we win it!” was the cry.
“Oh, you poor old Boarders!”</p>

<p>“They’re up in the air! They’re up in the
air!” chanted the coachers, leaping ecstatically
about at first and third. “Hit it out, Cap!
He’s easy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>And Prince, smarting perhaps over his first
fiasco at the plate, lined a swift one between
shortstop and third, sending in two more tallies
and placing himself on second by a fraction of
a foot.</p>

<p>“Five to nothing!” shouted the Towners joyfully.
“It’s a cinch! It’s a picnic! Here’s
Richard the First! Oh, you Dicky! Make it a
home-run, old man! Slam it into the brook!”</p>

<p>But Dick Furst was too anxious, for he found
the first ball offered and popped a tiny foul to
Dolph. The Boarders, delighted at having at
last something to celebrate, howled lustily and
the “band” did its level best—or worst! That
encouragement appeared to have its effect on
Hal Morris, for he steadied down and struck
out Tyler Wicks for the second time! Wicks
scowled at the umpire and slammed his bat
down angrily. The Boarders jeered loudly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you wicked Wicks!” “Say, Wicks,
your flame’s out!” “Why didn’t you hit it,
Tyler?”</p>

<p>With two out, Tom Coolidge stepped up
looking desperately determined, but Dolph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
knew Tom’s weakness for high balls and signaled
Morris accordingly. Coolidge was fooled
once and then hit a long fly to Truesdale in
centre field and the first half of the fatal inning
was over.</p>

<p>Hal Morris looked pretty miserable as he
went to the bench, but the others cheered him
up as best they could. “You’re doing all right,
old man,” said Ted consolingly. “You had a
little bit of hard luck; that’s all. You can hold
them down the rest of the game.”</p>

<p>But Morris shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Ted. My arm’s getting
pretty lame. I haven’t pitched more than five
innings for a long time, you see.”</p>

<p>“You’re up, Ted,” said Dolph. “Try a bunt
if he gives you a chance, and when you get to
second run on anything. We’ve got to get those
fellows going. They’ll make all sorts of errors
if we can only start them.”</p>

<p>Ted went to bat amidst the frenzied tooting
of the cornet, the wild beating of the drum and
the mingled strains of rattles, harmonicas and
other instruments. This riot of sound was, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
course, aimed at Mort Prince in the hope that
it would affect his pitching, but where there is
a deafening turmoil already a little sound more
or less doesn’t make much difference. Prince
tried Ted with a low one that was palpably a
ball, offered him one above his shoulder, and
then settled down to strike him out. But Ted
found what he wanted after a strike had been
called, connected with it lightly, loosening his
grip on the bat at the same moment, and
streaked for first. It was a slow trickling bunt
along the third base line and both catcher and
third baseman ran for it. Catcher got to it
first, scooped it up and threw to first, but Ted
beat out the ball by a narrow margin.</p>

<p>Cook was warned against hitting a long fly,
and yet did that very thing. As it happened,
however, it was scored as a sacrifice, for Ted
made second after the catch by right fielder.
With one out, Harry Smythe was up. The
shortstop was a good man on bases, but a poor
batsman, and with a hit necessary to score a
tally Dolph wished that some one else was at
bat. But Smythe surprised Dolph and himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
too, I fancy, by finding the second ball pitched
and placing it between first baseman and the
bag. Ted already had the signal and was
streaking for third before the crack of the bat
reached his ears. Dolph, coaching at third,
looked, took a chance and waved him home.
Right fielder had been a little slow in backing-up,
but now the ball was hurtling to the plate.
Ted, seeing that his only chance of scoring lay
in getting around the catcher, launched himself
toward the back of the bag just as the ball
thumped into the catcher’s mitt. There was a
cloud of dust and catcher and runner were for
a moment inextricably mixed up at the plate.
Then Mr. Shay said “Safe!” The Towners
howled protests and the Boarders shrieked
their delight. And meanwhile Harry Smythe
had reached third and was all for stealing home
in the confusion. But Dolph held him by main
force.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are, Harry. Play it safe.
There’s only one out. Run up the line and
rattle Prince all you can, but don’t get caught.”</p>

<p>Mr. Shay refused to reverse his decision at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the plate and the game went on. Joe Cassart
tapped his bat on the ground and faced Prince.
The latter was still peevish over the umpire’s
decision, and before he knew it had sent in two
balls. He steadied down then and worked a
strike. But the next attempt was also a ball,
and unholy glee seized the Boarders. <em>Toot-toot</em>
went the cornet; <em>thumpity-thump</em> went the
drum! Every one realized that here was a
psychological moment; that if the Towners
could be rattled for five minutes the score would
wear a totally different aspect. So all voices
along the first base line were raised at Prince.</p>

<p>“Careful now, Mort, careful!” “That’s it,
swing your arms up!” “Look out for your
foot! Don’t let it slip!” “A-a-ah! Right
over the plate!” “Wow! What a roast!”
“Strike nothing! It was way up!” “Now,
then, Mort! Once more! Heave——!”</p>

<p>“Four balls,” said Mr. Shay, and Joe trotted
to first. Watkins took his place. Dolph raised
his voice above the turmoil.</p>

<p>“On your toes, on your toes! Take a lead!”</p>

<p>Watkins threw a swift glance at him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gripped his bat. The signal for a double steal
on the first ball thrown had been given. At
first Cassart danced a good twelve feet from
base. At third Smythe ran up the base line,
shouting and waving his arms. Prince scorned
them both and pitched. It was a wide ball and
Watkins swung at it.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” yelled Grady, coaching at
first.</p>

<p>But the catcher knew better than to throw to
second with a man twenty feet from third. Instead
he recovered quickly and hurled the ball
to the baseman in an endeavor to catch Smythe.
As the ball left his hand Smythe streaked for
the plate. Third baseman caught it at arm’s
length and sped it back to the catcher. But
Smythe’s lead had been a good one and he
threw himself between the catcher’s legs and
reached home in safety. Meanwhile Joe Cassart
was almost at third. Back went the ball
there at a wild throw. Third baseman leaped
into the air in a heroic attempt to get it, but
it passed a foot above his hands and Cassart
rounded the base and tallied the third run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>There was still but one man out, and Watkins,
profiting by the general stage-fright, hit
an easy one to shortstop, who got it, dropped
it, found it again and then threw wide of first.
Watkins went on to second. A base hit would
score him, but Morris was not equal to the
emergency and plumped a short fly into the
second baseman’s mitt. The Towners began to
recover their equilibrium then, and, with two
strikes and only one ball, scored against him,
Truesdale looked like an easy out. But Prince,
possibly with a desire to end the wretched inning,
put one across “in the groove” and
Truesdale met it fairly. It went to right field,
and, although right fielder tried his best to
reach it, it fell to earth, a clean base-hit. Watkins
scored easily. Dolph went to bat next and
his supporters howled joyfully, for Dolph was
a good man with the stick. A hot grounder
between shortstop and second put Truesdale on
second and Dolph on first. Grady laid one
down in front of the plate and the catcher
hurled it to third in an attempt to cut off
Truesdale. But third baseman dropped it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and the runner was safe and the bases filled
again.</p>

<p>Ted was up for the second time in the inning.
With three on bases it was necessary to hit the
ball outside the infield. That, however, wasn’t
so easy, for Mort Prince had steadied down
and was once more pitching good ball.
“Strike!” said Mr. Shay.... “Ball!...
Foul! Strike two!... Ball! Two
and two!... Ball three!”</p>

<p>Ted gripped his bat. This one would have
to be a good one. And it was, and ball and bat
met. The result was a Texas Leaguer behind
first. Truesdale raced home, tallying the fifth
run and tying the score, Dolph made it 6 to 5.
Grady took third on the throw-in and Ted was
safe on second. Time was called while Mr.
Shay ordered the spectators back from the
base-lines. Cook went to bat looking like one
determined to do or die. But, when a clean
hit would have scored Ted, the best he could
do was to hit a liner to third baseman, who was
playing well in. Third shot the ball to second,
putting out Ted and ending the slaughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>But 6 to 5 looked pretty good to the Boarders
and they made the fact known unmistakably.
Dolph patted Morris on the back as that youth
walked to the pitcher’s box and picked up the
ball. His arm may have been tired and lame;
undoubtedly it was; but you wouldn’t have
guessed it during the fifth and sixth innings,
for only two Towners hit safely and only once
did a man reach second. In the same innings
the Boarders fared no better, for Prince struck
out four of the eight men who faced him.</p>

<p>In the seventh, the lucky seventh, as the
Towners hopefully proclaimed it, Morris began
to weaken. Two one-baggers started the trouble,
and a base on balls, with one out, made the
situation look rather desperate. A double-play,
however, neatly executed by Smythe, Dolph and
Ted caught a runner at the plate and nipped
the batsman at first, awakening loud jubilation
amongst the Boarders.</p>

<p>In the last of the seventh Jack, who had taken
Cook’s place at the beginning of the fifth, had
his first try at the bat, being the first man up
for the Boarders. He didn’t feel very hopeful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
as he faced Prince, and Prince, recognizing a
substitute, put the first two deliveries over at
different heights and scored two strikes. Then
came a ball. Then what looked to Jack like a
straight one swerved wide of the plate, fooling
him and causing him to hit at it wildly. He
was prepared to walk back to the bench when
shrieks of “Run, you chump!” sent him speeding
for first. Catcher had let the third strike
go by, and to do that today was fatal, for the
ball once lost in the crowd was extremely difficult
to locate, it being kicked here and there by
the spectators. Urged on by the coachers, Jack
went on to second and finally to third and
would have raced home amidst the urgent appeals
of the Boarders had not Mr. Shay waved
him back to first. Dolph objected to the ruling,
but the umpire was firm. Smythe fouled out to
third baseman. Cassart struck out and Jack
got his orders to steal. He shot away for second
on the first ball thrown and would have
been out had shortstop, who received the throw-down,
held the ball. But he and Jack collided
and the ball trickled away in the dust. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Jack got no further, for Watkins was an easy
third out, pitcher to first.</p>

<p>The Towners started a rally in the eighth that
looked very promising. Morris showed his
weariness plainly now, and the balls he pitched
wouldn’t have fooled any intelligent batsman.
That he received no worse punishment than he
did only proved the inability of the opponents
to take advantage of the situation. The first
man up hit safely for one base and then was
caught off. The next man lined a three-bagger
over center fielder’s head and might have
stretched it into a home run had he used more
speed and better judgment. Then came a base
on balls, followed by an easy steal to second.
The fourth man hit what looked like a safe one
into left field, but Jack made a fine run and
pulled it down, following that up with a throw
to the plate that caught the runner from third
a foot short of base and retired the side.</p>

<p>“What do you think about it?” asked Ted
wearily as he sank to the bench beside Dolph.
Dolph wiped his face on his sleeve and shook
his head doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“If there was only some one we could put in
for Hal,” he said, “we might hold them. But
Hal’s just about all in, and if the game goes to
extra innings he will be plugged all over the
lot and they will do what they like to us. Say,
Joe Cassart, you used to pitch, didn’t you?
Couldn’t you hold those chaps down for a couple
of innings?”</p>

<p>“Pitch? I never could do anything,” answered
Joe. “I used to try it, but I was no
earthly good. I’d do it in a minute, Dolph, if I
thought I could help. But you’d be worse off
than you are now, old man.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll just have to work hard and shut
them out,” said Dolph resignedly. “If Sam
Phillips ever shows up again I’ll have something
to say to him for being such an easy
mark!”</p>

<p>In the Boarders’ half of the eighth Morris
struck out miserably, Truesdale sent up a fly
to second baseman, and Dolph’s desperate attempt
to beat out a bunt resulted unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>“We must keep them from scoring,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Dolph to Morris as they went out again for the
first of the ninth. “How’s the arm?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can just about lift it,” answered
Morris grimly. “I’ll do the best I can, Dolph,
but I’m afraid they’ll paste me hard this time.
Give me all the high balls you can; they’re
easier to pitch. Who’s up!”</p>

<p>“Wicks. Let him hit it out, Hal. We’ll help
all we can.”</p>

<p>Morris nodded silently and walked to the
box.</p>

<p>“Batter up!” called Mr. Shay.</p>

<p>Wicks let the first delivery go by and scowled
indignantly when the umpire called it a strike.
Then Morris sent one across waist-high and
Wicks found it easily. It proved to be a long,
arching fly to centre field, and Truesdale should
have got under it without difficulty, but in some
manner that youth got his feet twisted and
measured his length on the turf at the very
moment he should have put his hands up.
Wicks went to second. Dolph turned away with
a groan, but down at first Ted clapped his
hands and shouted encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind that, fellows. Play for the
double!”</p>

<p>Coolidge swung at an easy one, popped up
three fouls in succession back of the plate—none
of which Dolph could get because of the interference
of the crowd—and then, with two
strikes against him, calmly and deliberately
waited and drew a pass! Morris looked dejected
as Gus Turnbull faced him. Coolidge
was taking a big lead at first and Dolph signaled
Morris to catch him. Morris swung
around quickly and heaved the ball. But his
arm was no longer dependable and the throw
went wild, and before Ted could get it both
runners had moved up.</p>

<p>Dolph waved the infield players in. “Play
for the plate now, fellows,” he called.</p>

<p>Turnbull hit a slow grounder toward shortstop
and Smythe, smothering it dexterously,
held Wicks at third for a moment and then
threw to first. He had waited an instant too
long, however, and Mr. Shay rendered a close
decision in favor of Turnbull. The bases were
full and no one out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Home run! Home run! Home run!</em>”
chanted the Towners in a wild chorus as Joe
Williams walked to the plate. The Boarders,
defeat staring them in the face, were a silent
lot.</p>

<p>Morris’s delivery was getting weaker and
more uncertain every minute. One ball....
Two balls.... Foul strike.... Three
balls.... Morris looked wearily to Dolph
for the signal, but that youth had turned his
back to the plate. There was a stir in the
crowd and then Dolph, snatching off his mask,
stepped in front of the batsman and called to
Mr. Shay:</p>

<p>“I want time, Mr. Umpire.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Mr. Shay impatiently.</p>

<p>“To change pitchers, sir!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>KIDNAPPED!</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The message that had taken Sam away
from practice had been brought to
him by one of the younger boys and,
scrawled hurriedly on the back of an envelope,
was as follows: “Sam: I’m at the gate in
the buggy and must see you, but can’t leave
the nag. Run up for a minute, like a good chap,
Chester. P. S.—<em>Important!</em>”</p>

<p>There were one or two things about which
Chester Harris might want to talk, Sam reflected,
but, since that matter was uppermost
to his mind at the moment, he believed that
Chester had something to confide regarding the
Towners’ plans for the game. So he tossed the
ball to Hal Morris and, without stopping to
change at the gymnasium, sought Chester at
the gate. Chester, whose father was the owner
of one of the larger mills in Charlemont and
very well off, was fond of driving and riding,
and, since his father’s stable was well filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
horses, was able to gratify his taste whenever
he wished. Today he was seated in a natty
runabout behind a handsome and very restive
bay mare.</p>

<p>“Hello, Sammy,” was Chester’s greeting.
“I’m glad you came because I’ve got something
to tell you; something you’ll want to hear, too.
Whoa, Judy! Stand still, can’t you. This
mare’s the fidgetiest thing I ever saw. She
doesn’t want to stand still a moment, but she
can certainly travel all right!” Chester looked
about him cautiously, but there was no one
nearer than the steps of South Dormitory.</p>

<p>“It’s about the game this afternoon, Sammy,”
he went on, lowering his voice. “Of course,
I’m a Towner, but there are some things——”</p>

<p>The horse began to show her impatience
again at that moment and Chester gave her his
attention.</p>

<p>“Whoa, you idiot! Say, Sammy, get in here
and we’ll drive around a bit. I can’t talk with
Judy dancing a two-step all the time.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got my togs on,” Sam objected, yet
looking longingly at the seat of the runabout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind; who cares? Whoa, you pesky
brute! Climb in, Sammy. That’s the ticket.
Now go if you want to!”</p>

<p>And Judy went. And for the subsequent
minute or two Chester had his hands full in
managing the horse. When she had settled
down into a long swinging trot that simply ate
up the Charlemont road Chester returned to his
subject.</p>

<p>“As I was saying, I’m a Towner, of course,
and I want to stick with the other fellows, but
there are some things that aren’t fair. I don’t
believe in going too far to win a ball game,
Sammy.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” commented Sam approvingly,
trying to suppress any note of eagerness
in his voice.</p>

<p>“So,” continued Chester, “when I heard
about it I made up my mind to sneak up here
and see you and let you know what the fellows
are up to. It sounds sort of—of traitorish,
though, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Chester viewed Sam anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” Sam replied judicially.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
“Of course, it’s possible to go too far, as you
just said, Chesty, and in that case I guess
you’ve got a right to refuse to go in with the
others.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But have I any right to give
them away, Sammy? That’s what’s troubling
me.”</p>

<p>Sam, who had the right-minded boy’s dislike
of anything savoring of treachery, rather
wished that Chester hadn’t put that question to
him. Of course, if Chester was silly enough or
weak enough to tell tales he wasn’t such a fool
as to refuse to listen, but, on the other hand,
he didn’t care to endorse any such doings. He
tried to beg the question.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s for you to decide, Chesty,”
he responded finally. “After all, it’s only a
ball game and it doesn’t much matter who wins
it. But I guess we’re certain enough of getting
it, old man.”</p>

<p>“Not if the Towners succeed at what they’re
up to,” replied Chester mysteriously.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what they could do that would
affect the real game much,” said Sam. “Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
course, they can rattle us and all that sort of
thing, but we’ve been up against that before
and beaten you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but this is—is something different,”
replied Chester darkly. “And I think it’s sort
of a mean trick to play.”</p>

<p>Sam’s curiosity got the better of his scruples
then.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see that you’re telling me very
much,” he said. “All you are doing is taking
me straight toward town at about a mile a
minute; and me in my dirty old baseball togs.
Turn the horse around, Chesty.”</p>

<p>Chester looked doubtfully at the road, which
was fairly narrow here, and shook his head
slowly.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’d better try that,” he answered.
“She’s awfully hard to turn when
she’s headed toward home and this road’s
pretty narrow, Sammy. If we were in the cut-under
it wouldn’t be so hard. I tell you what
we’ll do. We’ll go on to the stable and hitch
up one of the other horses. I don’t believe I
ought to drive Judy much more today. She’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
pretty soft; hasn’t been used much since we
got her.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be late for dinner,” Sam objected.
“What time is it, anyway?” He looked at his
watch and found that it was only a few minutes
past twelve. “Well, all right, but hurry it up
a bit. I’ve got to change before dinner, you
know.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take more than five minutes to
change nags,” replied Chester carelessly.
“Here’s the trolley road,” he added, as they
turned the corner, “and I hope we don’t meet a
car because Judy hates them like poison.”</p>

<p>“What do you drive such a fool horse for?”
asked Sam uneasily as he peered forward up
the tree-lined avenue. “Think I want to have
my neck broken?”</p>

<p>“You won’t,” laughed Chester. “There isn’t
a car in sight and we’re only two blocks from
home. Easy, girl, easy! She wants her dinner,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“And I want mine,” said Sam decisively.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll get it right on time,” responded
Chester lightly. “Whoa, Judy! Steady, girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
steady! That’s only a piece of paper and it
won’t hurt you. Here we are.”</p>

<p>The Harris residence was a big square
wooden house set in its own grounds in the
residence district of Charlemont. There was a
big lawn and a good deal of shrubbery and
many ornamental trees around the house. The
stable, which had been recently built, looked
almost as large as the residence. Judy sped
up the smooth gravel drive and whinnied
loudly and impatiently when Chester pulled
her down at the carriage room door.</p>

<p>“All right, Perkins?” called Chester.</p>

<p>A neatly dressed stable man appeared, apparently
doing his best to hide a broad grin
behind one of his large hands.</p>

<p>“All clear, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>Chester drove on into the carriage house.
“Put one of the other horses in, Perkins, will
you? I’m going to take Mr. Phillips back to
school.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Which one, sir? The Governor
hasn’t been out today.”</p>

<p>“He will do then. Better get out and stretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
your legs, Sammy. And, by the way, you
haven’t seen the room I’ve fixed up upstairs,
have you?”</p>

<p>“What sort of a room?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Come up and see.” Chester led the way to
a door and politely held it open for Sam to
pass through. The door revealed a flight of
stairs and Sam climbed them, Chester at his
heels. The upper floor of the stable was given
over at one end to piles of hay in bales and to
bins for feed and at the other was partitioned
off into rooms for the stablemen and coachmen.
There were six of these rooms, opening from
an entry that ran through the centre of the
building.</p>

<p>“Which way?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“First door to your left,” replied Chester.
“Go ahead in; it’s unlocked, I guess.”</p>

<p>Sam opened the door and entered. The room
was a small bedroom, and, seated on the bed
and on the two chairs which the place contained,
were four boys: Morton Prince, Joe
Williams, Milton Wales and Gus Turnbull.
For an instant Sam gazed in surprise. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
realization came to him and he turned and
made a dive for the door. But it was closed
and Chester stood grinning with his back to it.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Sammy,” said Prince.</p>

<p>“Enjoy your drive?” asked Gus Turnbull.</p>

<p>Sam shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“What are you fellows up to?” he asked indifferently.
“I suppose it’s some silly joke.
I’m going home.”</p>

<p>He tried to push Chester aside.</p>

<p>“That’s no use, Sammy,” said Chester.
“I’ve locked it.”</p>

<p>Sam scowled. “You think you’re going to
keep me here?” he demanded truculently.</p>

<p>“Until the game’s over, Sammy,” said
Prince. “We hate to do it, but we have to.
You know yourself it isn’t fair to make us hit
your pitching, Sammy. With you out of the
game the thing is sort of evened up. We stand
some slight chance of winning. You’ll be nice
and comfortable here. Dinner’s almost ready,
and after the game’s over Chesty will take you
back in the runabout. Of course, you’re a little
bit peeved now, but you’ll get over that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
There’s some magazines on the table there and
you ought to spend a very comfy afternoon.”</p>

<p>Sam listened, but his eyes were busy with his
surroundings. The room was some twelve feet
by ten in size and lighted by one window, which
looked from the back of the stable into the yard
of a house in the next street. But escape
through the window was evidently out of the
question, for the boys had removed a netting
of heavy wire from a ground-floor casement and
secured it outside the window here. Over the
door was a narrow transom, but Sam reflected
ruefully that it was scarcely large enough to
emit a thin boy, to say nothing of one of his
somewhat generous build. They had him hard
and fast. Realizing this, Sam addressed himself
collectively to his captors. What he said
wouldn’t look very well in print; besides, it
would take too much space to render his remarks
in full, while to abbreviate them would
give but a very faint idea of Sam’s eloquence.
The others listened patiently, viewing him more
in sorrow than in anger. When he was finally
out of breath Gus Turnbull said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t blame you, Sammy. That’s the way
I’d feel about it. But you’ll just have to make
the best of it, old man. Might as well laugh
as cry, you know. Guess we’d better be going,
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” answered Wales. “Sorry, Sammy,
but it’s the fortunes of war, you know.”</p>

<p>“Perkins will serve your dinner in a few
minutes,” said Chester. “Is there anything
you’d like especially, Sammy? We want you
to be as happy as—er—as circumstances will
permit.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” agreed Williams with a grin.</p>

<p>Sam made no reply. He went over to the
bed, which held a mattress but nothing more,
and took the seat vacated by Williams, thrusting
his hands into the pockets of his ball pants
and gloomily surveyed his shoes. He wondered
whether it would be worth while to try
and rush the door when they opened it to go
out. Four against one, however, was hopeless
odds, and he decided that it would be a useless
attempt.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t try the window,” said Chester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
“because, even if you managed to get through
the wire, you’d have a twenty foot drop. You
can make all the noise you like, Sammy; the
horses won’t mind and Perkins is being paid to
look after you. By the way, what I started to
tell you was that the Towners had decided to
kidnap you, Sammy. It may be wrong to give
them away, but there are some things I just
can’t stand for!”</p>

<p>Chester went out grinning and the rest followed.
The key turned in the lock and Sam
heard them go shuffling downstairs, talking in
low voices and laughing softly. He ground his
teeth and clinched his hands. In a moment the
footsteps died away, the door at the bottom of
the stairs closed and the place was silent. Sam
looked at his watch. It was one. There was
almost an hour before the game would begin,
he told himself, and in that hour he meant to
get out of there.</p>

<p>But when he had made the rounds of his
prison, tried the door, peered out of the window
and measured the transom again he wasn’t
so certain about it. The partitions were of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
inch boards, but without something more than
his pocket knife he didn’t believe he could cut his
way through them. Besides, even if he succeeded,
there was Perkins to reckon with, and
Perkins was a hefty, muscular-looking chap of
something slightly less than six feet! He went
back dejectedly to the bed. A minute or two
later sounds reached him and the key turned
in the door. Sam edged toward it, prepared to
spring through if he had the chance. But it
opened very cautiously and Perkins put only
his head in.</p>

<p>“I’ve got your dinner, sir, out here. Keep
over by the window and I’ll pass it in.”</p>

<p>“Your name’s Perkins, isn’t it?” asked
Sam with an amiable smile. The man smiled
back and nodded, pushing the door open and
setting a well-loaded tray on the chair just
inside.</p>

<p>“Perkins it is, sir. If there’s anything
you’re wantin’ just holler; I’ll hear you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Perkins, I want to get out of here,” Sam
replied ingratiatingly. Perkins wagged his
head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure, I know,” he answered. “Mr. Chester
told me you’d be wanting to go, but you
was to be kept here until he got back.”</p>

<p>“You know you have no right to detain me,”
suggested Sam, trying to speak sternly. Perkins
nodded again, but quite untroubledly.</p>

<p>“Orders is orders, though, sir.”</p>

<p>Sam ran a hand in a trousers pocket, pondering
bribery. But there was not so much as a
Lincoln penny in his ball togs. He determined
to try intimidation.</p>

<p>“Perkins,” he said gravely and kindly, “I
wouldn’t want to make any trouble for you,
because, as you say, you’re just obeying orders.
But in holding me here against my wishes
you’re—er—making yourself liable to prosecution
for kidnapping.” Sam paused impressively.
Perkins, who had drawn the door close
all save a space broad enough to accommodate
his thin face, listened respectfully and nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you may be right, sir. But, begging
your pardon, sir, there’s ice cream on that
tray and I’m thinking it’ll be melted pretty
quick, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind about the ice cream,” replied
Sam irascibly. “What I want to know is if
you’re going to keep me prisoner here against
my wishes and—er—the law?”</p>

<p>Perkins scratched his head reflectively.</p>

<p>“Orders is orders,” he said finally.</p>

<p>“But, of course, you knew that Chester was
only joking,” said Sam, essaying a chuckle of
amusement. Perkins smiled responsively.</p>

<p>“Sure, I knew,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was just his joke,” said Sam
heartily, arising and moving casually toward
the door. “He’s fond of a joke, Perkins.”</p>

<p>“He is, sir,” responded Perkins, drawing the
door a little further shut.</p>

<p>“Why, some of the jokes he gets off at school
are too funny for anything,” continued Sam.</p>

<p>“I can believe that, sir.” The door was now
closed all but a scant two inches.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d tell you about some of them, but
I’ve got to be going now. We have a ball game
on this afternoon, Perkins, and I’m going to
pitch for our team. It wouldn’t do for me to
be late, you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam was at the door now. He laid his hand
on the knob, but at the same instant the door
closed and latched and the key turned outside.
Sam lost his temper.</p>

<p>“Perkins!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t open this door at once I’ll kick
a hole through it! And what’s more the minute
I get out I’ll go to the police and have you
arrested!” To emphasize his threats Sam delivered
a kick that cracked a panel.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that, sir,” said Perkins soothingly
from beyond. “Begging your pardon,
sir, if I was you I’d eat my dinner before it
gets cold entirely.”</p>

<p>“Open the door!” cried Sam sternly.</p>

<p>There was no answer. On the stairs Perkins’s
boots sounded retreat. Sam stormed
and kicked at the door, but, although it was an
easy enough matter to crack the panels, the lock
held firmly. Besides, baseball shoes aren’t stiff
enough at the toes to make good battering-rams.
Sam retreated to the bed again, his foot
tingling. Presently philosophy prompted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to investigate what lay under the big napkin
on the tray. After all, he <em>was</em> hungry, and
whether he was to make his escape or remain a
prisoner he might as well eat meanwhile. It
was evident that Chester had intended that he
should not suffer for want of food, for on the
big tray were soup and fish and roast lamb and
three vegetables, milk, bread and butter, rhubarb
pie, ice cream and cake. Sam’s face
cleared.</p>

<p>“Gee,” he muttered, “this beats school
feed!”</p>

<p>He bore the tray across to the bed and placed
it on the mattress. Then he pulled a chair in
front of it and began to eat. He did full justice
to that repast. The viands weren’t very
hot, and the ice cream <em>had</em> melted somewhat,
but Sam wasn’t fussy and everything tasted
awfully good to him. If, he reflected, his absence
from the pitcher’s box wasn’t endangering
the success of the team, he would be quite
content. Twenty minutes later the dinner was
only a pleasant memory, and Sam, his hunger
amply satisfied, looked longingly at the bed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
for a moment the stern voice of duty grew very
dim. But to his credit he heroically resisted
the allurement of the mattress and once more
put his mind on the problem of escape.</p>

<p>The door was out of the question, and so was
the transom. To cut his way through a wall
was impracticable, since by the time he had
made a hole large enough to crawl out by
the game would be over. Remained, then, only
the window. He examined that carefully. The
lower sash was raised and Sam put out a hand
and tentatively tried the wire screen. It didn’t
seem very firm, and, putting all his strength
against a lower corner, he pushed. It gave.
Hopefully he looked around for something with
which to batter it. Fortunately the bed, an
inexpensive wooden one, had slats, and in a
trice Sam was working with one against the
edge of the screen. Out came a staple. Sam
put the end of the slat between screen and
clapboard and pried. It was easy now. In
ten minutes he had the lower part of the wire
netting bent out and upward and he was viewing
the situation despondently with his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and shoulders out of the window. Below him,
almost twenty feet distant, was the ground. To
complicate matters, a picket fence ran along
behind the stable at a distance of about eighteen
inches. If he could be certain of landing
on the farther side of the fence, in the next
yard, the drop might be feasible, but to land on
the pickets didn’t appeal to Sam. If he had a
rope, he reflected, escape would be simple. But
there was nothing of the sort at hand, and
there wasn’t even a sheet or blanket on the bed.
He might rip the cover off the mattress, cut it
in strips and tie the strips together, he reflected,
and so lower himself to the ground.
But that would take a long time and it was
already twenty minutes to two.</p>

<p>He sat down on the bed again and strove to
think of some better scheme. He wondered
why Perkins had not heard him knocking off
the screen and concluded that the stableman
was in the front of the building. Or perhaps
he was at his dinner! If he could only get out
of the room now it was likely he could escape
from the stable without being detected. There,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
however, was the rub. There was no way to
get out of the room save by the window, and
by the time he had made his rope of the mattress
ticking Perkins would be back. He viewed
the door darkly. If only it opened outward
instead of into the room he might batter it
down with the bed slat!</p>

<p>He went to the window again and looked out.
To climb down was impossible, since there was
nothing to put hand or foot on. By chance he
looked along the wall to the left. Not three
feet away was another window! If he could
reach that, gain the next room and so get out
into the hall, he was sure he could win to freedom!
He leaned as far out as he dared, and,
to his joy, saw that the next window was open
at the bottom. In a minute he had laid his
plans. Squirming back into the room, he seized
his slat and began a new attack on the screen.
It was necessary to work through the upper
part of the window and from a chair, and he
tried to make as little noise as possible. The
screen proved more stubborn than before, and
Sam’s efforts to be quiet made it slow work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
But in the end only one staple remained. He
had only to get that out, seize the screen before
it fell, and lift it into the room. He paused
to get his breath, and in that moment he heard
the sound of footsteps on the stairs!</p>

<p>He pushed the window sashes back as they
had been, slipped the slat under the bed, removed
the chair from in front of the window,
put the tray on it, and threw himself on the
bed just as a knock came at the door. He made
no answer until Perkins spoke.</p>

<p>“I’m after the tray, sir.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What?” asked Sam sleepily. “Oh,
that you, Perkins? What’s wanted?”</p>

<p>“I’m after the tray, sir.” The key turned
and Perkins opened the door cautiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Come in and get it.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather you’d hand it to me,” replied
Perkins dubiously, realizing that if he crossed
the room for the tray Sam could easily slip out
of the door.</p>

<p>Sam considered. He didn’t want the stableman
to notice the screen, now hanging bent
and awry at the window, and so the only thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to do was to get him out as soon as possible.
Sam arose, grumbling.</p>

<p>“You might at least let a fellow sleep, Perkins.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir.”</p>

<p>“Here’s your tray.” Sam picked it up and
carried it to the door.</p>

<p>“Just set it down, if you please, sir, on the
chair. Thank you, sir. I hope you enjoyed
your dinner.”</p>

<p>“So, so,” replied Sam with a yawn, retreating
again to the bed. “What time is it, Perkins?”</p>

<p>“About two, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is that all? Guess I’ll go to sleep again.”
Sam pillowed his head in his arms. Perkins
took up the tray, cast a glance about the room
without detecting the condition of the screen,
closed and locked the door and stamped off
downstairs. Sam arose with a chuckle and
shook his fist in Perkins’s direction.</p>

<p>“I’ll fool you yet, you old dunderhead!” he
murmured.</p>

<p>Discretion prompted him to wait a while before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
beginning operations again. When some
ten minutes had passed, and there were no
sounds indicating a return on the part of the
stableman, Sam went back to his labors. The
final staple was wrenched out and Sam pulled
the mutilated wire screen into the room and
hid it under the bed. Then he pulled his cap
down firmly and clambered over the window
sashes. Standing on the ledge outside and holding
on to the casement, it was easy enough to
reach across and lower the sashes of the next
window. Then, a trifle uneasy at the thought
of that picket fence beneath, he stepped across
to the next ledge, and from there, after some
effort, squirmed over the sashes into the adjoining
room.</p>

<p>This room was similar in size to the one he
had escaped from, and, like it, was untenanted.
Best of all, however, the door was wide open
and the entry lay before him! That was a
relief, for all along Sam had been haunted by
the fear that when he gained this room he
would find himself only out of the frying pan
into the fire. For, with this door locked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the outside, too, he would have been no better
off than before. He tiptoed across the floor,
which squeaked alarmingly, and listened at the
doorway. All was silent. He looked out. The
dim entry was empty. Some ten feet distant
was the stairway and freedom!</p>

<p>Retreating to a chair, he removed his shoes,
for the cleats made too much noise when he
walked. He tied them together with the laces
and again tiptoed to the door. There was no
sound to be heard, save an occasional stamp from
one of the horses in the farther end of the
stable. He advanced along the entry cautiously
and as he passed the door of the room from
which he had made his escape, the key met his
eyes. With a malicious grin he extracted it and
dropped it into his pocket, leaving a locked door
to puzzle Mr. Perkins should that worthy seek
admittance. The stairway was dark, and the
door at the foot of it was tightly closed. That
presented difficulties. Supposing, when he had
opened the door, he found himself confronted
by the stableman! If only it were possible to
determine Perkins’s whereabouts!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he began the descent of the stairs,
trying each step with his foot before trusting
his entire weight to it. Even then one or two
of them creaked ominously and caused Sam to
stop and listen. At the bottom he crouched
against the door with his ear close to the keyhole,
which, as it held a key, could not be seen
through. He could hear nothing. At length he
made up his mind to risk it, and very softly he
turned the knob. Luckily the latch worked easily
and without noise. Then he pushed the door
open the merest crack and peered through. Before
him was the carriage room with several
vehicles lined along the further end. No one,
however, was in sight. He opened the door a
little more, increasing his field of vision. Gradually
the wide doorway came into sight, and a
flood of sunlight from outside. Sam ventured
his head around the edge of the door, only to
pull it quickly back again. For, sitting at the
left of the carriage room door, <a href="#i_fp090">tilted against
the casing in the sunlight and reading a newspaper,
was Perkins</a>!</p>

<small>THREE OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Sam noiselessly closed the stairway door
and subsided on the lower step, a prey to
disappointment. To win by Perkins was
out of the question, while to reach the stable
end of the building, where the stalls were, he
would have to cross the room diagonally and
be in plain sight of Perkins the whole distance.
Of course, he might do it so quietly as not to
be heard, but that was doubtful; and after he
had reached the stalls he might find himself
unable to leave the building. He must try for
some other avenue of escape.</p>

<p>Back up the stairs he went and turned
toward the loft in which was stored the hay
and grain. From this, at the front, was a gable
with two hinged doors through which the hay
was brought from below with rope and tackle.
But the doors were closed and padlocked, and
although Sam searched about for the key it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was not to be found. The only other outlet
was a window looking straight down into the
service yard of the house, and here again he
would have to have a rope of some sort. That
put a new idea into his head and he started a
search for something with which to lower himself.
And in the midst of it there was a noise
below; the sound of wheels and voices, and then
the unmistakable entrance of a carriage into
the carriage house. There was an animated
conversation between Perkins and some one
else, probably a coachman, and then the horse
was unhitched and led into the stable below.
Sam retreated toward the piled-up bales of hay,
and scarcely a minute too soon, for the door
at the foot of the stairs opened and the coachman
came up. Sam peeped from his hiding
place and saw the newcomer, a younger man
than Perkins, go along the entry and open the
door of one of the rooms on the front of the
building. He left the door open behind him,
and Sam could hear him moving about and
whistling a tune. Beneath, Perkins was taking
the harness off the horse. Now was Sam’s opportunity!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
He crept stealthily to the stairway,
and saw to his delight that the coachman had
left the door ajar. Down he went, step by step,
and at the bottom peered out into the carriage
room. It was empty, and from beyond came
the sound of Perkins’s steps and the drag of
harness. For a moment Sam hesitated. Then
he left his hiding place and started across
toward the door. And at the same instant Perkins
appeared at the opposite corner of the
room with a bridle in his hand.</p>

<p>“Billy!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Sam did the first thing that occurred to him,
which was to drop just where he was. Perhaps
had he made a dash for the door he would
have got safely away, but the advent of the
stableman had startled him. Perkins had his
gaze fixed on a corner of the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Billy!” he called again.</p>

<p>There was an answering hail from upstairs
and Sam seized the opportunity to creep
into the shadow of the brougham that had
come in and still stood in the middle of
the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“What time’s the master want the carriage?”
asked Perkins.</p>

<p>“Three-thirty,” replied Billy from above.
“I’ll take the sorrel, John.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Perkins walked to the door,
humming a tune, and looked out. After a moment
he draped the bridle over the back of the
chair and seated himself again, rescuing his
newspaper from the floor. Sam’s heart sank.
Perkins had only to look in his direction to see
him, for although his body was hidden by the
carriage his legs showed beneath. Well, if Perkins
came for him on one side he would run
around the other. Once out of the stable, Sam
believed himself a match for the stableman, although
running in one’s stocking feet was no
great fun.</p>

<p>“John!”</p>

<p>It was the coachman’s voice, and he was evidently
at his window.</p>

<p>“Hello!” answered Perkins. He left his
chair and walked out on to the drive. Like
a flash Sam pulled open the door of the
brougham, tumbled himself in and softly closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
it again. Huddled on the floor of the carriage,
he raised his head until he could see from the
window. Perkins was still standing outside
talking up at Billy in the window. As the
brougham was tightly closed Sam missed what
was said. Finally, however, Perkins returned
to his chair and his newspaper. There was a
clock in the carriage and it said ten minutes to
three! Even if he managed to get away he
would miss most of the game, for it was a good
mile and a half back to Maple Ridge. He wondered
what Perkins would do were he to open
the brougham door and make a run for it. Of
course the stableman had not the least right in
the world to stop him, but there was something
in Perkins’s face that told Sam that Perkins
wasn’t greatly concerned about the rights of
the matter. In short, Perkins looked like a man
who would do as he was told, no matter what
the consequences. There was nothing for it but
to stay where he was and await an opportunity
to slip out undetected. The minutes passed
laggingly. Perkins finished one page of his
paper and turned to the next. It was very hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and stuffy inside the brougham, with a strong
odor of leather and upholstery. If only Perkins
would go upstairs to have a look for the
prisoner! But Perkins apparently entertained
no doubts as to Sam’s whereabouts, congratulating
himself, doubtless, that the latter was
causing so little trouble. Sam viewed the clock
again. It was five minutes past three. He
changed his cramped position, wishing he dared
to curl himself up on the seat.</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded on the stairs and the
coachman appeared, yawning. Perkins put
aside his paper, took up the bridle and went
for the horse. Had Billy followed him Sam
was prepared to make his dash for liberty.
But Billy got a big feather duster and went
over the brougham. Sam wondered whether
he would open the door and discover him. But
he didn’t. He confined his attentions to the outside
of the carriage, still yawning sleepily, and
before he was through Perkins led the sorrel
in.</p>

<p>Sam smiled gleefully. If only he could
remain unseen there on the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
brougham he could ride to the end of the drive,
open the door and jump out!</p>

<p>The sorrel was backed into the shafts and
harnessed up. Billy took his blue coat with
the silver buttons from a peg and slipped it
on.</p>

<p>“Did you dust the cushions?” asked Perkins.
Sam’s heart stood still.</p>

<p>“Sure I did,” responded Billy untruthfully
as he climbed to the box. “Whoa, boy. All
right, John.”</p>

<p>The carriage moved, turned and a flood of
sunlight reached Sam. They were outside the
stable and moving slowly down the driveway!
In the front of the brougham was a wide pane
of glass through which Sam could see the box
and Billy’s blue-clad back, and through which
Billy, if he cared, could see Sam! But Billy
never suspected that he had a passenger. As the
drive made a turn Sam glanced back and saw
Perkins once more seated at the carriage house
door with his paper in hand. Sam grinned
broadly. Then he untied his shoes and hurriedly
thrust his feet into them. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
time to lace them up, for the carriage had
reached the gate. As Sam had expected, Billy
turned the horse’s head toward the business
centre of town. Opening the door of the
brougham just as Billy clicked to the sorrel and
the sorrel started into a trot, Sam leaped lightly
into the road and slammed the door behind
him. Billy turned startledly and pulled up his
horse. But Sam was scudding in the opposite
direction as fast as his legs would carry him.
At a safe distance he turned and looked back.
The brougham was still motionless and Billy
was gazing after his late passenger with open
mouth. Sam waved him a farewell and trotted
on, chuckling enjoyably.</p>

<p>He had hoped that a trolley car would happen
along and give him a lift as far as the Maple
Ridge road, but there was none in sight, and
a moment later Sam recollected the fact that
he had no money and so wouldn’t have got very
far anyway. It was nearly half-past three now.
He no longer hoped to reach school in time to
take part in the game. All he did hope for was
to arrive in time to confront Chesty Harris and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the others and, backed by the indignant Boarders,
give them a bad five minutes!</p>

<p>The sun was still pretty hot and the road was
dusty and Sam heartily wished that Billy had
been going in this direction instead of the other.
He turned into the Maple Ridge road, pausing
a moment at the fountain there to have a drink.
Then removing his coat and mopping his face,
he went on. He wasn’t trotting now, but he
stepped out briskly and, having found his second-wind
presently, made good time. It was
well toward four o’clock when he entered the
deserted campus at Maple Ridge. That none
of the fellows were in sight proved that the
game was still in progress, so Sam hurried by
the gymnasium and down the terrace walk.
The crowd was too thick about the plate for
him to see much, but Watkins out in right field
showed that the Towners were at bat. So
interested were the watchers in the contest that
Sam joined them unseen, and it was only when
he pushed his way through the throng about the
plate that his advent was noted.</p>

<p>A wild cheer went up from the Boarders as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Sam laid his hand on Dolph’s arm, and they
began to press around him. Questions fell
thick, but Sam waved them aside.</p>

<p>“They caught me this noon and locked me up
in Chesty’s stable,” he said shortly. “I just
got away. How’s it going, Dolph?”</p>

<p>“Six to five in our favor,” replied Dolph succinctly.
“First of the ninth. Three on bases,
none out, and Morris pitched to a standstill.
Can you go in?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” The light of battle flamed in Sam’s
eyes. “Six to five, you say? Let’s get at it!”</p>

<p><a href="#i_frontis">Sam shed his coat</a>, tossed it to Midget Greene
<a href="#i_frontis">and walked toward the plate</a>. Over on the
Towner’s bench the news of Sam’s arrival had
awakened first incredulity and then dismay.
The bench emptied as the fellows crowded up
to see for themselves. But there was Sam as
large as life and twice as cheerful.</p>

<p>“How the dickens did he get out?” whispered
Mort Prince to Dick Furst.</p>

<p>“Search me,” growled the other. “Where’s
Chesty?”</p>

<p>Chesty was nearby, looking very shamefaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and explaining volubly to a group of Towners
that he couldn’t understand it at all!</p>

<p>“Well, he’s here,” said Drake disgustedly.
“Seems to me you might have kept him half
an hour longer. I said all along it wasn’t safe
to leave him there with no one to look after
him. They’ll beat us now; see if they don’t.
You make me tired, Chesty!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my fault,” protested Chester.
“We had him locked up so he <em>couldn’t</em> get out!
And Perkins was there watching him!”</p>

<p>“Well, he <em>is</em> out, isn’t he?” demanded Milton
Wales angrily. “What have you got to
say to that?”</p>

<p>Chester had nothing to say.</p>

<p>Hal Morris yielded the ball to Sam with a
weary smile.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ve got things in a mess,
Sammy,” he said. “It’s one strike and three
balls on him. Gee, but I’m glad you’ve come.
About one more up would have completely finished
me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must have done good work, Hal,
to keep those Indians down to five runs. Run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
along now and don’t worry. I’ve got a score
to settle with these chaps.”</p>

<p>Sam waved Joe Williams out of the batsman’s
box and proceeded to warm up to Dolph.
A couple of the balls he sped in were pretty
wild, one going by Dolph into the crowd, and
the Towners howled derisively. After all, Sam
had had no chance to limber up, and, clever as
he was, it was well-nigh impossible for him to
shut them out with three on bases and none
down! So the Towners took heart and shouted
and sang and made all the hubbub possible.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” commanded Mr. Shay. “One
and three, Phillips.”</p>

<p>Back of first base Mort Prince was leaping
and waving his arms in his rôle of coacher,
while across the field at third Dick Furst was
doing all he could to worry Sam. Tyler Wicks
was on third, Coolidge on second and Gus Turnbull
on first. Sam looked over the field, smiled
pleasantly at Turnbull, who returned the smile
in a rather sickly way, and then gave his attention
to Joe Williams at bat. Dolph crouched
and gave the signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on now, fellows!” he called as he got
into position for the catch. “Out they go, one,
two, three!”</p>

<p>Probably none of his team heard the remark,
for Towners and Boarders were once more engaged
in their vocal war. But Williams heard
and his confidence, already disturbed by Sam’s
appearance on the mound, suffered a further
relapse. Sam settled his toes in the soil, twirled
his arms and shot the ball away. Williams let
it go by, as he should have with three balls to
his credit, and yelled a protest when the umpire
called it a strike. The Boarders yelled
gleefully. Williams gripped his bat tighter and
began to swing it nervously over the plate while
he awaited the next delivery. This, he argued,
was bound to be a good one, for if not it would
force in a run. Dolph gave the signal, but Sam
shook his head. Dolph gave a new signal and
Sam nodded. Sam knew pretty well what Joe
Williams would do in a crisis of this sort. He
knew that Joe would expect a straight ball and
would try for it. And as Joe was a fairly good
hitter it was more than likely that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
connect with it. So Sam sent him a ball that
looked very, very good until it was almost at
the plate. Then, as Williams swung at it, it
settled into a drop and the bat went harmlessly
over it.</p>

<p>“Strike! He’s out!” called Mr. Shay.</p>

<p>Howls of delight from the Boarders and of
disappointment from the enemy; peevish remarks
from Williams as he dragged his bat
away to the bench; redoubled noise and confusion
from the coachers.</p>

<p>“One gone!” called Ted at first.</p>

<p>Peters, the Towners’ third baseman, was the
next batter, and Peters was an open book to
Sam. Sam put the first one over, and Peters,
just as Sam had expected, let it go by without
an offer. Then Sam tried a high one and Peters
scoffed at it. Sam followed this with a slow
ball that cut the corner of the plate. Mr. Shay
called it a ball and Sam turned and regarded
him sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“That’s two!” yelled Prince. “Pick out a
good one, old man, and just meet it! Make him
pitch to you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The next delivery looked like the last, but it
swung in at the right moment and the umpire
called: “Strike! Two and two!” Dolph gave
the signal and then held his hands wide apart.</p>

<p>“Now, then, right over the plate, Sammy!”
he called. “He can’t hit it!”</p>

<p>Peters smiled craftily. If Dolph asked for
one over the plate it meant that the ball would
be a wide one, he argued. He was all ready for
it in case it should be good, of course, only he
wasn’t going to be fooled as easily as that!</p>

<p>“Strike! He’s out!”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” Peters stared open-mouthed at
Mr. Shay. “It was over my shoulder! Gee,
that’s a roast!”</p>

<p>But the batsman’s protest was drowned by
the roar of joy from the Boarders.</p>

<p>“Two down!” called Dolph.</p>

<p>“Two gone!” yelled Ted.</p>

<p>“Next man!” cried little Smythe, smiting fist
into mitt. Sam beckoned the fielders in as Milton
Wales stepped to the plate. Wales was a
heavy hitter and Sam’s show of confidence in
calling the fielders in made Wales scowl. Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
smiled at him sarcastically as he rubbed the
ball on his trousers.</p>

<p>“Where’ll you have it, Milt?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Anywhere I can reach it,” answered Wales
angrily.</p>

<p>“Give him a good one,” called Dolph.</p>

<p>Sam nodded carelessly and shot a high ball
that sent the batter staggering back from the
plate.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit him!” begged Dolph.</p>

<p>The next one looked pretty good and Wales
swung at it. There was a crack as bat and ball
met and in an instant he was racing to first
and Wicks and Coolidge were streaking for the
plate. But the ball, a hard and low fly, came to
earth in Finkler’s meadow, a foul by many
yards.</p>

<p>“Foul! Strike!” called Mr. Shay, tossing a
new ball to Sam. Sam waited while Wales
walked back to the plate.</p>

<p>“Try again, Milt,” he said as the Towner
went past him. Wales scowled. The tumult
had subsided, for both sides were far too excited
to shout. Wales picked up his bat again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and stepped into the box. Dolph gave his signal.
Sam wound himself up and pitched a wide
one that was nowhere near the plate. But
Wales, angry and nervous, stepped out and almost
struck at it. Sam smiled as he leaned
down to rub his hand in the dirt. He had
learned what he wanted to know. Wales was
“up in the air.” Sam had no doubt now of the
outcome. He refused Dolph’s next signal, put
his fingers to the brim of his cap, got his reply
from Dolph, a cheerful “Now then, Sammy!”
and hurled the ball. Straight as an arrow it
shot, right across the plate, waist-high, as
beautiful a strike as ever was pitched. And
Wales knew that it was good and slugged at
it, and missed it clean! What a yell of triumph
went up from the Boarders!</p>

<p>“He’s easy, Sammy!” shouted Dolph as he
returned the ball. “Give him another one like
that!”</p>

<p>Sam nodded nonchalantly, cast his gaze about
the bases, smiled at the anxious faces of Prince
and Furst and then turned and spoke to Mr.
Shay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Time!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>“What for?” shrieked Mort Prince.</p>

<p>“I want to tie my shoe,” replied Sam
sweetly, as he knelt and went through the motions.</p>

<p>“He’s delaying the game!” cried Prince. “I
protest, Mr. Umpire.”</p>

<p>Sam arose, picked up the ball and nodded.</p>

<p>“Play!” said Mr. Shay.</p>

<p>But still Sam was in no hurry. He put his
head on one side and studied Dolph’s signal intently,
thought it over for a moment and then
shook his head. Dolph tried again and again
Sam pondered. All this time Wales was swinging
his bat more and more nervously, the Towners
were hurling insults and protests and Prince
was dancing with rage. At last Sam nodded,
threw his arms up very slowly and stepped forward
and launched the ball. It was a slow one.
Wales leaned forward, his bat poised. An instant
of suspense. Then he swung. There was
a thud as the ball struck Dolph’s mitt and the
next moment the crowd was over the diamond.
Wales had struck out!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>They caught Sam before he could run, and,
high on the shoulders of three Boarders, he
went swaying and bobbing up the hill to the
gymnasium, the rest of the team following in
similar fashion amidst a tumult that made all
previous efforts seem weak and futile. The
Boarders had won, 6 to 5, and they meant that
the world should know it!</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Sam was a hero amongst the Boarders for
many days. But, as Sam himself said
and as most of the fellows agreed, the
real hero of the game was Hal Morris, who,
with very little preparation and small experience,
had held the Towners’ hard batters to a
mere half-dozen hits. Poor Morris’s right arm
was so lame for days after the contest that he
could scarcely use it. But when he could Mr.
Shay took him in hand, declaring that he was
going to make a pitcher out of him before the
season was over.</p>

<p>Of course Sam had to recount the tale of his
kidnapping and imprisonment and escape from
beginning to end to a circle of interested Boarders
before he had been off the field ten minutes
that afternoon. They gathered about him in
the gymnasium and demanded a full and detailed
account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Dolph, “they certainly had
their nerve to try a trick like that! And it
would have worked, too, if you hadn’t got back
here just when you did. Hal’s arm was getting
like a rag.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have stood more than one more
batter,” said Morris, with conviction, supporting
the weary limb with his left hand. “I was
never any gladder to see any one than I was to
see Sam.”</p>

<p>“Well, we beat them, after all,” sighed Ted.
“But I wouldn’t have offered a lead nickel for
our chances at the beginning of the ninth
inning!”</p>

<p>“I’d have sold out for a penny with a hole
in it just before Sam arrived,” said Dolph
grimly.</p>

<p>“The only regret I have,” announced Sam,
“is that I didn’t have a chance to strike out
Mort Prince. I have a feeling that it was he
who got up the scheme.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do to him, Phillips?”
asked Midget Green eagerly. Sam smiled
gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going to bite his head off, kid. Want
to see it?”</p>

<p>“I’d do something if it was me,” answered
Midget with an appalling scowl.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no use being grouchy about it,”
said Smythe. “Everything goes in a Towner
game. And after all, we licked ’em.”</p>

<p>“Shucks,” said Sam, “I don’t hold any
grudge. They were too smart for me and I got
what was coming. I ought to have had my
eyes open. I don’t see now why I didn’t suspect
something when Chesty insisted on going
home to change nags. I was an idiot, that’s
what I was, fellows!”</p>

<p>“On the other hand,” mused Truesdale,
“since they tried kidnapping this time there’s
no knowing what they may do next year. Steal
the diamond, like enough!”</p>

<p>Sam didn’t see Chester again until Monday
morning. Then he ran into him in the corridor
of School Building. Chester smiled in a doubtful
way, as though he was not at all certain
whether Sam was going to cut him dead or
punch his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello, Chesty,” said Sam jovially.</p>

<p>“Hello,” answered Chester with vast relief.</p>

<p>“Pretty good game, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Y—yes, pretty fair, Sammy.”</p>

<p>“It was a dandy! And I was glad I got back
to see the last of it.”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t,” said Chester with a grin,
“we’d have licked you fellows good and hard.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought. So I concluded I’d
better leave my cosy quarters and hike back to
the field of battle. By the way, I had a dandy
dinner, Chesty. Thanks awfully, old man.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I say, Sammy, aren’t
mad about it, are you?”</p>

<p>“Mad? What for? It was lots of fun. Hope
I didn’t do any damage to the place, though.”</p>

<p>“No. But, say, Sammy, I wish you’d tell me
how you got out of there.” Sam winked and
looked mysterious.</p>

<p>“Why, by the window, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I said,” responded Chester,
“but Perkins is sure he didn’t take the
key out of the door. And when we went up
there afterwards the door was locked fast. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
guess he put the key in his pocket and forgot
it. He can’t find it, though. I gave him fits for
letting you get away.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry about the key, Chesty.
Here it is.” Sam dug it out of his pocket and
passed it over.</p>

<p>“H—how did you get it?” gasped Chester.</p>

<p>“Just took it out of the door.”</p>

<p>“But—but you said you got out by the window!”</p>

<p>“I said that? You must be dreaming. I
went out by the door, of course.”</p>

<p>“But—but it was locked on the outside!”</p>

<p>“Was it? Funny I didn’t notice that. Are
you sure?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am!” responded Chester puzzledly.
“How <em>did</em> you get out, Sammy?”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t tell any one, Chesty?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the other eagerly. Sam
leaned across and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>“I pried the screen off——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw that.”</p>

<p>“Tied my shoe laces together and lowered
myself to the ground! Quite simple, you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tied your——Oh, cut it out, Sammy, and
tell me!”</p>

<p>“All right, Chesty. After I ate my dinner I
hid myself in the sugar-bowl, drew the lid on
and Perkins carried me out on the tray. He
never suspected, Chesty!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be a fool!” said Chester crossly.
“Can’t you tell a fellow?” Sam shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, Chesty,” he said solemnly, “that’s
something you’ll never know.”</p>

<p>And he never did.</p>

<p>That afternoon, the school baseball supremacy
settled for the year, the School Team reassembled,
Towners and Boarders together, and
settled down to practice again. On Wednesday
the Charlemont High School came out, and was
beaten, 12 to 4, in a six-inning game. Sam
pitched four innings and Prince finished. As
Tyler Wicks was back in left field, Jack spent
the afternoon looking on. Cook went in for
two innings, but Jack’s turn didn’t come that
day.</p>

<p>Midget Green almost wore himself out
during that game, chasing the fouls that went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
into Finkler’s meadow, and the visitors had
several sarcastic things to say about Maple
Ridge’s baseball field. Four balls were lost
utterly, a circumstance that caused Chester
Harris, as manager, much annoyance. Chester
had supplied himself with only a half dozen
balls, and in the fifth inning was forced to
send back to the gymnasium for more. Balls
are expensive, too, and after the game Chester
remarked gloomily that if Finkler would only
sell his meadow it would pay them to buy it
and quarry it for baseballs.</p>

<p>“It’s a nuisance,” agreed Dolph weariedly.
“I think we ought to insist on Benny supplying
the school with a decent field. There’s a perfectly
good piece of land across the road there.
Why doesn’t he buy that?”</p>

<p>“Can’t be did,” answered Gus Turnbull.
“That land belongs to some one out west, and
he won’t sell. I know, because my father and
some other men tried to buy it a couple of years
ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, Benny ought to find us a decent place
somewhere,” responded Dolph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“What we ought to do,” remarked Jack
quietly, “is to get hold of that meadow.”</p>

<p>“What meadow?” asked Dolph impatiently.
“Finkler’s?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“He’s daffy on that subject,” laughed Sam.
“Wakes me up at night to talk about it. I tell
him Finkler won’t part with his old land, but
that makes no difference with Jack. He keeps
right on talking!”</p>

<p>“How do you know he won’t sell or rent it?”
asked Jack with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s been asked to twenty times, I
guess.” This from Ted. “Anyhow, five or six
times.”</p>

<p>“Why not ask him again?” persisted Jack.</p>

<p>“No use,” said Sam with finality, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>“How do you know it is no use? Remember
what you told me the other day, Sam? You
said that all folks weren’t mind readers, and,
sometimes, when you wanted a thing, you had
to speak out. Maybe Finkler’s had a change
of heart since he was asked the last time. Maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
if he knew we wanted his field, or the use
of it, he’d be glad to let us have it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe a cow’s an insect,” scoffed Turnbull.
“Old Finkler would never have a change
of heart. His heart’s too tough to change.”</p>

<p>Jack made no reply, but his smile told them
that he was not yet convinced. As he was leaving
the gymnasium with Sam, Dolph stopped
him.</p>

<p>“Borden, you and Sam run over this evening,
will you? I’m not plumb sure there isn’t something
in that idea of yours. Anyway, it won’t
hurt to chew it over a bit. Maybe we can hit
on a plan.”</p>

<p>They did hit on a plan at length, but not until
they had talked for the better part of an
hour. Sam was very much of a pessimist on
the subject, and threw cold water on the project
until the others got tired and threatened to put
him out of the room.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” he said then, settling himself
comfortably in an easy chair. “Go ahead
without me. I’ll take a nap. Wake me up when
you’re through chinning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think Borden’s idea is a good one,” said
Ted when Sam had subsided. “As captain of
the baseball team, Dolph, you’re just the fellow
to start it. Have a talk with Steve Walker
and Thorp Prentiss. If they agree you’ve got
the baseball, football and track interests combined.
And, anything you three captains do
the school will stand back of.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how about Benny?”</p>

<p>“I’d go to him and tell him that you need
the field,” said Jack. “Ask him if he will
allow you to go ahead and see what you can do.
I think it would be better to simply ask Finkler
for a lease of the meadow, say for ten years; I
guess he’d be more likely to lease it than sell
it.”</p>

<p>“I want some one else to make him the offer,
though,” said Dolph with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Let Jack do it,” suggested Sam. “He’s
got a grand gift of the gab.”</p>

<p>“Thought you were asleep,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“I am. I’m talking in my sleep.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t do it,” answered Ted severely.
“We’re getting on nicely, so don’t butt in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hear him!” murmured Sam, addressing the
world at large. “Getting on nicely! Talking
rot, that’s what they’re doing!”</p>

<p>“How much, though, do you suppose the old
codger would want to charge us for the meadow?”
asked Dolph.</p>

<p>“More than it’s worth,” replied Ted
gloomily.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” said Jack. “It isn’t much
good to him now except for pasture, and the
amount we’d need wouldn’t make much difference
to his cows and horses.”</p>

<p>“I should say not! Why, Finkler’s got over
a hundred acres, I heard.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Ted agreed. “And I guess
he doesn’t own more than half a dozen cows
and a few horses.”</p>

<p>“Horses!” exclaimed Sam. “He’s got
twenty of them, if he’s got one! He raises
them. And they say he cares more for his old
nags than anything else.”</p>

<p>“That so?” asked Jack. “Well, I don’t believe
a man who has to do with horses and
likes them can be so bad, after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose he has some good points,”
allowed Dolph. “I never heard that he beat his
wife. And we all know that he goes to church
regularly. You can see him any day.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got any wife,” said Sam. “He’s
a widow—I mean a widower.”</p>

<p>“The real trouble with Old Finkler,” observed
Ted, “is that he hates Maple Ridge and
everything about it.”</p>

<p>“But why?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we’ve always rubbed him the
wrong way.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s rub him the right way; smooth
him down,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“H-m; I don’t believe he will let you get
near enough to do any smoothing. He will
probably set that old dog on you as soon as you
put foot on his land.”</p>

<p>“If Rowdy bites us,” said Ted comfortingly,
“we’ll sue Finkler for damages.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get your damages beforehand,” answered
Dolph, with a laugh. “Well, that’s settled
so far, then, fellows. I’ll talk to Steve and
Thorp Prentiss tomorrow. Then, if they’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
come in on it, we’ll all three of us talk to Benny.
And if Benny will give us a free hand, we’ll
make a formal call on Finkler and put it up to
him. After all, he can’t do any more than chase
us off the premises!”</p>

<p>“Tell him,” suggested Jack, “that we want
to lease a small part of his field for five or ten
years; that we won’t change it any except to
put part of a running track on it, and that we’ll
agree to put it in the same shape as we found
it in at the end of the lease.”</p>

<p>“And tell him we’ll agree not to bother him
or his old apples again,” added Ted. “The
apples I got from there last fall weren’t extra
good, anyway!”</p>

<p>“But where’s the money coming from if he
should agree?” asked Dolph.</p>

<p>“He oughtn’t to charge much,” answered
Jack. “Dr. Benedict could give half and the
school could make up the rest.”</p>

<p>“Benny ought to pay it all,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he would. Anyway, if he
wouldn’t the fellows could make up the rest,
I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe,” Ted suggested, “we could interest
the graduates in it.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s find out first whether we can
have the land. It will be time enough then to
find a way to pay for it. Just at present, gentlemen,
I am going to study a little.” And
Dolph pulled his books toward him, intimating
that the conference was over.</p>

<p>Three days later, on Saturday morning, the
three captains called on Dr. Benedict. The
Principal received them in his library, a big,
book-lined room behind the office, with which
the students were less acquainted than with the
latter room. Doctor Benedict was a man of
medium height and middle age; clean-shaven,
with a pair of keen gray eyes looking more
often over than through the glasses perched
perilously on a short nose. In the interims of
conducting Maple Ridge School the Doctor
found time to write text-books on physics that
were widely used. There were those who maintained
that the real head of the school was Mrs.
Benedict, the Doctor’s shrewd and energetic
wife, whose official position was that of matron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Both were well liked by the fellows, Mrs. Benny—as
she was called—perhaps a bit more than
the Doctor, probably because her duties brought
her into closer touch with the students.</p>

<p>Dolph acted as spokesman, and the Doctor
listened attentively to his presentation of the
matter. When Dolph was through, the Doctor
swung around in his swivel desk-chair, placed
the tips of his fingers together and looked out
of the window for a minute. It was a favorite
trick of his to apparently seek inspiration from
the view.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” he said finally, “I see nothing
wrong with your scheme, and you have my full
consent to try it. I don’t predict success, however.
Mr. Finkler has been approached on
numerous occasions and has always proved a
difficult—ah—gentleman to deal with. The fact
of the matter is simply that he has cultivated
an unreasoning prejudice against the school,
the faculty and the students. We have offered
to buy his land or to lease it, and we have
proffered more money than it is really worth.
He has always refused to even consider the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
matter. Whether he has altered his attitude,
I can’t say. I doubt it, however. But there is
no harm in talking to him, boys. It may be
that he will listen more patiently to you than
he ever has to me. I wish you success.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Dolph. “And if he
should consent to let us have the land, would
you—er—help us pay for it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. The matter of terms, however,
I would advise you to leave open until we can
talk it over again. Had you considered making
him a definite proposition, Jones?”</p>

<p>“We hadn’t decided on any amount, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, our last offer to him was to lease
two acres of the property for ten years at a
yearly rental of, I think it was, three hundred
dollars. For the property outright, our offer
was two thousand.”</p>

<p>“That seems a lot, sir,” hazarded Prentiss,
the Track Team captain.</p>

<p>“Too much,” replied the Doctor. “The land
isn’t worth it; at least, it isn’t worth it to any
one else. But, as you boys have just said, the
athletic field, as it is now, is really inadequate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
The school would be quite willing to buy or
lease at those figures, and if you can persuade
him to let us have the land the money will be
ready.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged, sir,” said Dolph. “I don’t
believe he will do it, but we <em>do</em> need the land,
sir, and I guess there’s no harm in trying.”</p>

<p>“There never is, Jones,” replied the Principal
smilingly. “Good luck to you, boys. Let
me hear how the negotiations turn out.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t call on the old codger today,”
said Dolph, when they had left the Doctor.
There was a ring of relief in his voice, and
the others laughed.</p>

<p>“No, nor tomorrow,” added Steve Walker,
the football captain, “for tomorrow’s Sunday.
It’ll have to be Monday, I guess. Who’s going?”</p>

<p>“The three of us,” answered Dolph.</p>

<p>Walker made a grimace of distaste. “I don’t
think I agreed to that, did I?” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Of course you did!”</p>

<p>“Did I? Well, let me tell you one thing,
Dolph: I don’t propose to get bitten by that old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
dog of Finkler’s. I shall carry a good-sized
club.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what, fellows,” Prentiss suggested.
“Let’s get a carriage. That’ll look
business-like, and—er—important, and the dog
can’t get us!”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea,” agreed Dolph. “Not that
I’m worrying about the dog——”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly not! Perish the thought!”</p>

<p>“But it will make Finkler realize that we
mean business.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can get Chesty Harris to take us
over in one of his turnouts.”</p>

<p>“Sure; he will do it,” said Dolph. “Well,
shall we say Monday?”</p>

<p>The others hesitated. Finally—</p>

<p>“I—I expect to be pretty busy Monday,”
faltered Prentiss.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t squirm out that way,” replied
Dolph firmly. “We’ll go over on Monday, the
three of us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Walker, “maybe we might as
well, and get it over with. Things don’t get
any better for waiting.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Maple Ridge played her second
game that afternoon, winning from
Warrenton High School, 11 to 5.
Jack played in left field during the last four
innings, and did very well; so well, in fact, that
Cook, who was Jack’s competitor for the
position of first substitute, was a bit worried.
Cook was only a fair batsman, and, although
he had been playing ball for three years, seemed
unable to improve. Jack, on the other hand,
was beginning to show an ability with the stick
that for an inexperienced player was almost
startling. In the Warrenton game he made two
hits, one a clean liner past second and the other
of the scratch variety, and when the game was
over had a run to his credit besides. In the
field he had two chances and got them both.
Hal Morris pitched the first three innings, and,
while Warrenton touched him up pretty freely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
he was able to hold the opponents down to four
hits. Although Mort Prince didn’t say so, I
believe he was secretly regretful that he had
connived at the kidnapping of Sam, since if it
hadn’t been for Sam’s absence from the field
the preceding Saturday Morris would, perhaps,
have never proved what he was capable of. Still,
there were many games ahead, and Maple Ridge
had full need of all the pitchers she could find.</p>

<p>After school on Monday, Chester Harris
drove the Peace Embassy, as they called themselves,
to Farmer Finkler’s. Chester had provided
a two-seated carriage and a stylish roan,
which, it was hoped, would attract Mr. Finkler’s
admiration and perhaps soften his heart. They
had to drive nearly a half-mile, for, although
the Finkler property and the school grounds
adjoined, yet the farmer’s residence was at the
end of a long lane, and his entrance was some
distance up the road from the school.</p>

<p>On the way they rehearsed their programme.
Chester was to remain outside. Dolph was to
ask to see Mr. Finkler, and he and Prentiss and
Walker were to enter. Dolph was to do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
talking, although it was agreed that the others
were to stand by and be ready with their voices
in case of an emergency. The proceedings were
to be conducted with much dignity and politeness.
The situation demanded diplomacy.</p>

<p>But, alas for all their preparations! The
roan danced stylishly up the lane, between apple-trees
already showing signs of blossoming,
and stopped in front of the doorway. Rowdy,
evidently not suspecting that the carriage held
ancient enemies, arose from the lawn and
wagged his tail in welcome. Rowdy was a
brown dog. There were various theories as to
his breed. Some declared him to be a collie;
others were equally certain that he was a water
spaniel. All, however, agreed that he was not
to be trifled with. Dolph, who descended first
from the carriage, observed him attentively as
he lowered his legs within reach. But Rowdy
only stood off across the drive and wagged his
tail slowly and inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Nice dog,” murmured Dolph ingratiatingly,
as he turned to the steps.</p>

<p>“Brute!” said Chester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t call him names, please,” begged Prentiss,
as he prepared to follow Dolph. “He
might understand you. It’s all well enough for
you, Chesty, but kindly remember that we are
unprotected.”</p>

<p>The house was a large, rambling affair, immaculately
clean and white. At a little distance
were a stable and a barn, and beyond were paddocks
in which a number of horses and colts
were ambling about. Big elms shaded the
buildings, a glimpse of fertile fields and meadows
showing beyond, and altogether Farmer
Finkler’s place looked prosperous and attractive.
There was an old-fashioned knocker on
the front door, and with the expression of one
about to enter a den of lions, Dolph raised
it and beat a faint tattoo. That was the
signal for Rowdy to bark, and the boys
looked around nervously. But evidently the
dog only meant to aid them in summoning the
inmates, for he still wagged his tail and kept
at a respectful distance. The door was opened
by a young girl of about fourteen or fifteen,
a decidedly pretty girl, too, as Dolph, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
susceptible to feminine attractions, enthusiastically
proclaimed afterwards. She had shimmery
brown hair and violet-blue eyes, and a
slightly tip-tilted nose. At present the eyes
were politely inquiring, as she stood in the dimness
of the hall holding the door open and facing
the visitors.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” began Dolph, after his
first surprise. “Is—is Mr. Finkler at home,
please?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; my father is away just now,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Dolph vaguely.</p>

<p>As he showed no disposition to add to this
clever remark, Prentiss entered the field.</p>

<p>“Will he be home soon, Miss?” he asked. The
girl shook her head. She had begun to blush
a little, which was not to be wondered at, considering
that Dolph was still staring at
her.</p>

<p>“He has gone to New York. I don’t expect
him back until Thursday.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Prentiss. Whereupon Walker
took up the burden of conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’re very sorry to have missed him,” he
said in relieved tones and with a broad smile
on his face.</p>

<p>“Is there—is there any message I can give
him?” asked Miss Finkler.</p>

<p>“N—no, thanks. We—we called to see him
about——”</p>

<p>“About a matter of business,” interrupted
Dolph, emerging from his trance and smiling
engagingly at the young lady. “We will call
again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll call again,” echoed Prentiss.</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Walker, backing away from
the door.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said Dolph. “Good—good
morning.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” replied the girl. “If it is
very important, I can give you his address in
New York.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thank you,” said Prentiss. “It—it
isn’t that important. It was only about——”</p>

<p>“About some business,” said Dolph helpfully.
“We’ll come again after he returns.
Good mor—good afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The door closed and the boys returned to
the carriage.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t she pretty?” demanded Dolph, as
they climbed back to their seats.</p>

<p>“Stunning!” agreed Prentiss. “I don’t see,
though, why it was necessary for you to break
in every time I tried to talk to her.”</p>

<p>“Dolph was trying to make a hit,” said
Walker. Dolph stroked an imaginary mustache
and smiled engagingly.</p>

<p>“I shall ask her to the Class Day Dance,” he
announced. The others jeered.</p>

<p>“I see you doing it!” said Chester. “Old
Finkler would scalp you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, by that time he and I will be great
chums,” replied Dolph. “I shall cultivate his
acquaintance. Might have done it before if I’d
known he had such a pretty daughter.”</p>

<p>“Wonder,” remarked Walker, glancing regretfully
back at the house, as they turned into
the road, “why we never knew about her. She’s
the prettiest girl around here!”</p>

<p>“Rather young, though,” said Prentiss superiorly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Y-yes,” Walker agreed.</p>

<p>“Young for you chaps,” said Dolph, “but
I’m only seventeen. I think she rather liked
me, too. Did you see her blush?”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t she, when you were staring
her out of countenance?” asked Prentiss unkindly.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” remarked Chester
Harris, “she was looking at me most of the
time.”</p>

<p>“Huh! If she looked your way at all, it was
probably the horse she noticed. The <em>horse</em> is
good-looking, Chesty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’re no Adonis yourself,
Dolph,” growled Chester.</p>

<p>“Too bad we couldn’t find Finkler,” said
Prentiss in tones expressing vast relief.</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m broken-hearted,” said Walker.
“Hit up that nag of yours, Chesty, and get us
home.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go again,” declared Dolph
firmly.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” Prentiss agreed vaguely.
“When did she say he would be home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thursday, I think.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it a week from Thursday?” inquired
Walker innocently.</p>

<p>“It was not.” This from Dolph very sternly.
“We’ll call again on Friday.”</p>

<p>“Not for me,” Prentiss declared. “Friday’s
a very unlucky day.”</p>

<p>“Only for journeys.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a journey to Finkler’s isn’t it?
I might be able to go Saturday, though.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll say Saturday morning,” declared
Dolph. “Don’t you chaps try to get
out of it.”</p>

<p>The others made no answer and Dolph
viewed them suspiciously. “Hear?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we hear. Of course, we haven’t
any idea of getting out of it. I should say not!
‘See your duty and do it,’ is our motto, isn’t
it, Steve?”</p>

<p>Walker agreed that it was, adding that he
hoped it wouldn’t rain Saturday morning. At
which Prentiss and Chester laughed, and Dolph
grunted disgustedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“You fellows would like me to do this whole
thing alone, I guess,” he observed bitterly.</p>

<p>“Not if you don’t want to,” replied Walker
sweetly. “We only thought that perhaps you’d
like to go by yourself. You see, Dolph, you’d
make more of an impression on Miss Finkler
if Thorp and I were not present with our fatal
beauty.”</p>

<p>But when Saturday morning came, Steve
Walker couldn’t be found, and Prentiss refused
to go without him. On the following Monday
it was Dolph who couldn’t get away, and so
the visit was put off and delayed until a whole
fortnight had gone by, by which time Walker
and Prentiss had lost interest in the matter
and even Dolph showed a strong inclination to
let things slide. Dolph had sufficient excuse,
however, for the captain of the Baseball Team
has plenty of work and plenty of problems to
keep him busy. In that fortnight Maple Ridge
played four games, winning two and tying one.
The latter contest, with Dixon Academy, ran
to twelve innings, and then was called, with
the score 8 to 8. That was Maple Ridge’s fifth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
game of the year, and in it the home team
showed a vast improvement over its work in
the Charlemont game. The single defeat was
suffered at the hands of Blue Ledge School,
Maple Ridge being shut out without a run, and
with only three hits to her credit. But Blue
Ledge was a big school, and its baseball team
was a rattling aggregation of hard-hitting fellows,
who averaged two years more than Maple
Ridge in the matter of age. Sam pitched the
entire contest, and was lucky to hold the opponents
down to seven hits and four runs.</p>

<p>It was in the following game, that with Holt
School, that Jack finally ousted Cook from the
position of first substitute right fielder. It was
a close game all the way, with the score seesawing
back and forth for six innings, first
Holt and then Maple Ridge being in the lead.
The seventh began with Holt one run ahead. It
ended with Maple Ridge leading by two tallies,
9 to 7. Mort Prince, who was pitching, held the
enemy scoreless the first half of the eighth. Maple
Ridge was unable to add to her figures in the
last half. In the first of the ninth, Prince weakened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
A pass put a man on first; a sacrifice
bunt advanced him to second. The next batter
was out on an infield fly. With two down, a
slow grounder to Cassart at third put a man
on first and advanced the first runner to third.
The man on first stole on the first ball pitched.
Holt’s centre fielder, a powerful hitter, was
up. Dolph signaled Prince to pass him, and
Mort began to throw wide of the plate. All
went well until three balls had been sent in.
Then Prince slipped up and sent one that cut
the edge of the plate. The batter, who resented
being passed, leaned against it, and it went
sailing out to short left field, well over third
baseman’s head, and yet so close behind him
that Jack, who had been playing in left since
the beginning of the sixth inning, was unable
to reach it, although he came running in at top
speed. As it was, the ball struck the ground
two yards in front of him, just as the man
from third crossed the plate. Jack got the ball
on the bound, poised and made a hard, straight
throw to the plate, just in the nick of time
to head off the second runner, who was trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
his best to bring in the tying run. It was a
nice bit of fielding, and the Maple Ridge supporters
cheered long and loudly as Jack trotted
in, peeling off his glove.</p>

<p>“That was a dandy throw-in you made,” said
Sam later. “As straight as an arrow, Jack,
and right into Dolph’s mitt.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Jack modestly, “I saw I
couldn’t catch that fly, so I slowed up for the
bound. The man from second was just leaving
third then, and I heaved as quick as I knew
how. And when I did throw, Sam, I remembered
what you’d told me and I kept my eyes
and my mind on Dolph; and I said to that ball,
‘Get there!’”</p>

<p>“And it got!” laughed Sam. “And I dare
say, it saved us a licking, or, at any rate, another
tie game. You keep on improving, Jack,
and you’ll make Tyler hustle to keep his place.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll never be as good as Wicks is,”
answered Jack. “He seems to know just where
the ball is going the minute it leaves the bat.”</p>

<p>“So will you when you’ve played as long as
he has. Study the game, Jack. Keep at it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course. It’s pretty good fun, anyway,
even if I don’t get into the big games.”</p>

<p>“Well, you keep on batting as well as you
have been, and you’ll do that, too. You’ve got
Cook settled already, I guess.”</p>

<p>Sam was right, for in the next game but one
Jack went in at the start, Tyler Wicks being
on the hospital list for the time, and played
such a good game that Mr. Shay put on his
thinking-cap and tried to find a place for Jack
in the regular line-up. A day or two later, in
practice, Jack was surprised to find himself in
right field, a position that had been fairly well
filled by Watkins, with Joe Williams as substitute.
After he had grown accustomed to the
change of territory, Jack did well enough there,
the only thing that bothered him being the disconcerting
proximity of Farmer Finkler’s stone
wall, which lay close at his left. Once or twice
a long fly from Mr. Shay’s bat sent him almost
up to the wall, and any player knows how difficult
it is to keep one’s mind on the ball when one
is expecting at any instant to collide with such
an unyielding obstacle as a wall or fence. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that, Jack played in right and left, and, once
or twice, in centre, and it was plain to be seen
that Mr. Shay was training him for an all-around
outfielder. This didn’t please Jack very
well, for he preferred having a settled goal to
strive for. Besides, a utility man, which he was
fast becoming, was quite as likely as not to
adorn the bench when the important games
came along. But Jack worked away cheerfully
enough, and did what he was told to the best
of his ability. Only to Sam did he voice his
regret.</p>

<p>“I’d rather he’d left me in left field, Sam.
Then I might have got into a part of a game
now and then. As it is, with Wicks ahead of
me, and Watkins and Williams and Truesdale,
why, I don’t see where I come in!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you? I do. Shay’s going to use you
for a substitute outfielder, Jack, and a pinch-hitter.
That’s why he’s been keeping you at
the net all the afternoon. You’ve got a sort
of lucky way of connecting with the ball that
Shay takes a fancy to. Don’t you worry, chum,
you’ll get your show all right. Being a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
handy man won’t keep you from falling into a
regular place when the place is ready. Meanwhile,
what you want to do is to bat and bat
and then some. You’ve got a good eye, old man,
and you’re going to make a fine old hitter some
day. And I’m glad I discovered you!”</p>

<p>“So am I,” laughed Jack. “I’m a grand discovery.”</p>

<small>JACK GETS A LIFT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was about a fortnight after the unsuccessful
visit to Farmer Finkler’s that Jack
asked permission to cut practice and go
to town. His mission in Charlemont was the
purchase of a straw hat, for the weather, it now
being almost the last of May, had become decidedly
warm and cloth caps were no longer
comfortable. Coach Shay gave the desired permission
readily enough and Jack set off at three
o’clock. The town was a good mile and a half
by road, and as one didn’t strike the trolley line
until he had traversed the first two-thirds of
the distance, going to town was something of
an undertaking on a hot day. There was a
nearer route, but it lay over the hill and
through pastures and by devious ways, and
Jack had been over it but once and doubted his
ability to reach Charlemont by that trail. So
he struck out down the road, keeping to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
shade where there was any, and wishing that
some one would come along and give him a lift.
And so when the sound of wheels did reach his
ears he turned around and viewed the approaching
vehicle anxiously. It proved to be a
side-bar buggy, dingy and much in need of a
coat of paint or varnish, occupied by a
single person. Jack congratulated himself and
stopped to await it. If the buggy wasn’t much
to boast of, the horse, on the contrary, was a
beauty, a young bay with dark points that came
swinging along the dusty road as though he
thoroughly enjoyed every movement of his
strong supple muscles. The driver was a man
of middle age, a prosperous farmer from his
appearance. Jack stepped out into the road as
the buggy came up and held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Will you give me a lift, sir, please?” he
asked.</p>

<p>The buggy went by and for a moment Jack
thought that the occupant had either not heard
or didn’t want to comply with the request. But
the horse was finally pulled up some fifty or
sixty feet beyond and the driver turned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
beckoned peremptorily to him. Jack hurried
down the road.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” asked the man. He
had a deep, gruff voice and for the first time
Jack noticed that he didn’t seem a particularly
amiable sort of person. He had an iron-gray
beard and heavy eyebrows of the same hue, a
long thin nose and steely blue eyes that bored
into one like gimlets. The face was deeply
wrinkled and darkly tanned. He wore black
clothes that seemed too loose for even his large
and rugged body and a queer broad-brimmed
felt hat of snuff color. Jack, with the man’s impatient
and unfriendly gaze on him, wished that
he had not asked for a ride. But the colt was
pawing impatiently and, having made the start,
Jack determined to go on with it.</p>

<p>“I’m going to town, sir,” answered Jack.
“I thought if you didn’t mind I’d like a lift.
It’s pretty hot walking; dusty, too.”</p>

<p>“Get in,” said the man gruffly.</p>

<p>Jack climbed to the seat, the driver flicked
the reins and the horse whisked them off down
the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The man gave all his attention to the horse,
which, impatient of the stop, was inclined to
be frisky, and for the first few minutes there
was silence in the buggy. Presently, however,
the driver, without turning his head, put a question.</p>

<p>“You one o’ them Maple Ridge boys?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Huh!”</p>

<p>Silence descended again. They reached the
main road and turned eastward with the trolley
track.</p>

<p>“Live in this part o’ the country, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, my home’s in Wichita, Kansas.”</p>

<p>The farmer turned for the first time and
viewed Jack with a slight display of interest.</p>

<p>“Want to know,” he said. “Thought you
weren’t quite as smug as those others.”</p>

<p>Jack was uncertain of the meaning of the
word smug, but he decided to put a complimentary
interpretation on it and so smiled
pleasantly. Jack’s smile was hard to resist.
The farmer saw it said “Huh” again, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
less unpleasantly and gave his attention to the
horse, which was showing a tendency to bolt
at the approach of a car.</p>

<p>“That’s a mighty pretty horse,” said Jack
after quiet was restored. The farmer nodded.</p>

<p>“Know anything about horses?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not much, sir. We used to have two or
three when I was a kid, but when my father died
we sold them.”</p>

<p>“Father’s dead, eh! Mother still with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Got any brothers or sisters?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a kid brother about eight and two
sisters. One’s three years older than I and
the other’s twelve.”</p>

<p>“How’d you happen to come here to school?
Haven’t you got schools out West?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, sir, but father came from this part
of the country and he always wanted me to go
to school hereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Like it?”</p>

<p>“Very much. The fellows are a fine lot, I
think.”</p>

<p>“Fine lot! Fine lot of scallywags!” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
farmer disgustedly. “Seems like you had some
sense, but I guess you’ll be just like the rest of
’em after you’ve been there awhile. Mean,
sneaky lot of young varmints, I call ’em!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you don’t like them, sir,” replied
Jack coldly. “Perhaps you haven’t met the
best of them.”</p>

<p>“Met ’em? Only place I ever met ’em was in
my apple orchard.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jack. “You—you’re Mr.
Finkler, then?”</p>

<p>“That’s my name. Didn’t you know who I
was?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, or I wouldn’t have——” Jack
stopped.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t have what?” demanded Mr. Finkler.
“Wouldn’t have asked me for a ride, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, sir—I mean yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Guess you’re the first Maple Ridge
boy ever got a lift from me. And the last,
likely. Young rascals!”</p>

<p>“I guess if you’ll stop, sir, I’ll get out,” said
Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here? Thought you were going to town?”</p>

<p>“I am, but as you don’t like Maple Ridge
boys and as I’m one of them I won’t trouble you
any longer, Mr. Finkler.”</p>

<p>The farmer shot a glance at him and flapped
the reins lightly. “Huh,” he grunted, “sort
of high an’ mighty, ain’t you? ’D rather walk
than ride with me, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to stay where I’m not wanted,”
replied Jack haughtily.</p>

<p>“Who said you weren’t wanted?” demanded
the farmer gruffly. “Guess you wouldn’t be
here if you weren’t wanted. What did you say
your name was?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say, but it’s Jack Borden.”</p>

<p>“Christened Jack, were you?”</p>

<p>“John.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you call it John then? Ain’t
that a good enough name? John was my
father’s name and his father’s name, too; and
it’s mine. Good sensible name, I call it.”</p>

<p>“My mother called me Jack, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she did, eh? Well, mothers have that
right, I guess. How you going to get home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Back to school, do you mean, sir? I guess
I’ll walk. I don’t mind, because it will be
cooler by that time, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Going to be in town long?”</p>

<p>“Not very,” replied Jack, undecided whether
to be resentful or amused at the farmer’s questioning.
“I’m just going to get a straw hat.”</p>

<p>“What do you want a straw hat for? I never
wore one in my life. They’re hot things.”</p>

<p>Jack glanced at the heavy felt on Farmer
Finkler’s head and smiled.</p>

<p>“I don’t find them so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Don’t eh? Well, you be around Worden’s
drug store in about half an hour and I’ll give
you a lift back to school; that is, if you aren’t
too high an’ mighty to accept a seat in my humble
equipage.”</p>

<p>“I’m not high and mighty at all,” replied
Jack with heat. “I’m much obliged, sir, but
I guess I’d rather walk.”</p>

<p>“All right; suit yourself. Thought you were
kind of a sensible boy, but I guess you’re a
regular Maple Ridger after all. Where do you
want to get out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“This will do, right here, thank you,” replied
Jack, as the buggy swung into Main street,
where the stores began. Mr. Finkler pulled the
horse down and drew the buggy in toward the
curb. Jack descended.</p>

<p>“I’m very much obliged to you for my ride,
Mr. Finkler,” he said stiffly.</p>

<p>“You are, eh? Well, don’t tell your friends
up there to school that I gave you a lift.”</p>

<p>“Why not, sir?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Because,” responded the farmer with a
grim smile, “they’d think you were lying. Huh!
Get ap!”</p>

<p>Jack’s shopping took him only about ten minutes.
After that, with the new straw hat on
his head and his cap stuffed into his pocket, he
strolled about in front of the stores for awhile,
looking in at the windows and jingling the remaining
coins in his possession tentatively. But
he saw nothing that particularly appealed to
him and so finally turned off of Main street and
headed back toward Maple Ridge. Perhaps the
thermometer had dropped a degree or two since
he had left school, but the change wasn’t apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and it was still uncomfortably warm.
He wished he had not quarreled with Farmer
Finkler. After all, the latter had not said nor
done anything that Jack need have taken umbrage
about. If the farmer didn’t like the
Maple Ridgers, as he called them, and said so,
why, the boys themselves frankly acknowledged
that they had given him plenty of cause for that
dislike. There was still time to retrace his
steps to the drug store and save himself a long,
hot walk to school. But after thinking it over
Jack decided that he would rather walk than
humble himself to the school’s hereditary
enemy. Besides, there was the chance that
some one else would be going his way and would
give him a lift. He looked back in the hope
that a trolley car would appear and help him
over the first stage of his journey, but none
was in sight and rather than stand there on
the sun-smitten pavement and wait for one he
walked on.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he was wondering whether,
after all, Farmer Finkler might not be right in
his theory regarding straw hats, for the one on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Jack’s head <em>was</em> decidedly hot! He took it off
and wiped the perspiration from the leather
band. Then he wiped his forehead. Then he
put the hat on again, tilting it toward the back
of his head to relieve his forehead. So absorbed
in these proceedings was he that he
didn’t hear Farmer Finkler until that gentleman
had pulled the horse down to a walk and
spoke.</p>

<p>“Nice and cool, ain’t it?” There was a gleam
of amusement in the farmer’s eyes. Jack
turned in surprise.</p>

<p>“Not very,” replied Jack, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” The farmer stopped his horse.
“Climb in,” he said. “I waited for you awhile
at the drug store, but you didn’t come.”</p>

<p>Jack hesitated a moment. Then he swallowed
his pride and got into the buggy. “It’s pretty
warm walking,” he murmured apologetically.</p>

<p>“Yep, it’s hot weather for the time o’ year,”
Farmer Finkler allowed. “Good growing
weather, though. Hay’s coming along nicely.
Guess if we have a week or two like this I can
begin cutting pretty early.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose you have a lot of land, sir,” inquired
Jack.</p>

<p>“’Bout a hundred and fifteen acres altogether.
Most of it’s in grass. I use a heap
o’ feed at my place. Eighteen or twenty head
o’ horses and half a dozen cows eat a lot. Hay
and grain’s about the only crop I raise nowadays.”</p>

<p>Jack was silent a minute, debating. Here
was an opportunity to sound Mr. Finkler on
the subject of the land they wanted to get, but
whether it was advisable to mention the matter
was a question. In the end he decided to take
the risk.</p>

<p>“I suppose, sir,” he began, “you could get
along pretty well with two or three acres less,
couldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I could,” replied Mr. Finkler cautiously.
“Want to buy a piece, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; at least the school wants to.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Wants a slice o’ my west meadow; I
know all about that, young man! They’ve been
wanting it a long time and they’ll keep on wanting
it, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you—won’t consider selling a little
of it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir! Why should I? Benedict wants
me to cut a slice right off that meadow there
so’s his boys can play ball on it. Ball! Huh!
I’m not saying that if he wanted it for a building
or something useful I wouldn’t consider
selling to him. I guess I could get on without
that corner of land. But why should I cut up
that meadow just so’s a lot of worthless rascals
can throw a ball around over it? Ain’t they
got room enough as it is, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, that’s just it,” replied Jack quietly.
“They haven’t got nearly room enough. I’d
like to explain it to you if you’ll let me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to hear it,” grunted the farmer.
“It’s all been explained time and time again.”</p>

<p>“Not very well, then, I guess,” said Jack
with some asperity, “or you wouldn’t persist in
saying that we have land enough.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t, eh? Well, you explain it, then.
Not that it’s going to make a mite o’ difference,
though, young man.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see that there’s much use in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
my wasting my breath,” answered Jack with
a frown. “However, here’s just how it is, Mr.
Finkler. You see, baseball and football and
the other games we play on our field require
a certain amount of room. I dare say, sir,
you’ve noticed that on a baseball field the outfielders
are pretty well spread out.”</p>

<p>“Are they? Well, young man, I never saw
a game of baseball, but I’ll take your word for
what you say.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you ever play it when you were a
boy?” asked Jack in genuine surprise.</p>

<p>“No, I never did,” replied the farmer grimly.
“I got my exercise chopping wood or hanging
on to the tail end of a plow. Never felt any
desire to chase a ball around a field, neither.
Long about eight o’clock I’d had all the exercise
I wanted and I was good and ready for
bed. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, what I was saying was that the outfield
of a baseball ground has to be pretty wide.
Our field isn’t nearly big enough, sir. If you
knock a foul into right field it goes over your
wall and we have to chase over for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“And knock my wall down while you’re doing
it,” added the farmer.</p>

<p>“We don’t mean to, sir.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I suppose you don’t mean to steal
my apples! I suppose you didn’t mean to set
fire to my hay cocks!”</p>

<p>“We didn’t do that, Mr. Finkler!” declared
Jack earnestly. “I wasn’t here then, but I’ve
heard the fellows say over and over again that
they had nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Lies!”</p>

<p>“No, sir, they’re not lies! Fellows like Ted
Warner and Dolph Jones don’t tell lies!”</p>

<p>“Don’t, eh? Didn’t ever steal my apples I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“I think they have done that, sir, but—but
swiping a few apples isn’t exactly stealing—”</p>

<p>“Huh!”</p>

<p>“I mean, Mr. Finkler, boys don’t consider it
stealing. It’s a—a sort of a lark, sir. Why,
didn’t you ever steal apples when you were a
boy?”</p>

<p>Mr. Finkler turned a somewhat startled look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
at Jack and quickly shifted his gaze back to
the horse.</p>

<p>“Don’t know as I ever did,” he said cautiously.
Adding, after a moment, “Maybe—once
or twice.”</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t consider it stealing, did
you?” demanded Jack triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Huh! You ought to be a lawyer, young
man. So you think those boys didn’t fire my
hay, do you?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it, sir,” answered Jack earnestly.
“And if you want to know something,
Mr. Finkler, I guess when you accused us of
doing that and refused to believe us when we
told you we knew nothing about it you—you
sort of made things worse. I mean that it
made the fellows sort of angry to be accused of
such a mean thing, and so they—they kind of
set out to annoy you, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Succeeded, too,” said Mr. Finkler dryly.</p>

<p>“The fellows are willing to promise never to
swipe any more apples or do anything to annoy
you, sir, if you’ll let us have that piece of land.
We do need it awfully, Mr. Finkler.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh!”</p>

<p>“You see, sir, if we had it we’d have a decent
baseball field and a better football field and we
could build a running track so that we
wouldn’t always get beaten at the track and
field meets.”</p>

<p>“Want to build a road, you mean, through
my meadow?”</p>

<p>Jack explained. “And if you didn’t want to
sell the land to us outright, sir, you could lease
it for ten years or so. And if you did that we’d
agree to put the land back in just the shape we
found it when the lease ran out. Wouldn’t
that be all right?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Well, here’s where you live.
Whoa, Dick!”</p>

<p>“You’ll think it over, won’t you, Mr. Finkler?”
asked Jack as he got out of the buggy.
The farmer shook his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t need to,” he answered.</p>

<p>“You mean that you—that you won’t do it?”
asked Jack disappointedly.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Tell those friends of yours that
they can get all the exercise they need with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
saw and a pile o’ cord wood. And they won’t
need any more land than they’ve got now.”</p>

<p>“I think—you’re a little bit unreasonable,”
replied Jack, stifling his exasperation.</p>

<p>“Do, eh? Well, maybe, maybe. We’re all
likely to think that of another person who won’t
do what we want him to.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d think it over, sir,” said Jack
wistfully.</p>

<p>Farmer Finkler gazed thoughtfully between
Dick’s ears.</p>

<p>“Don’t know but what I’d be willing to do
it if those young rascals were all like you, boy.
But they’ve been making my life miserable for
five or six years and I guess I ain’t ready to
cry quits yet. Sometime when you ain’t got
anything better to do you come over and see
me and I’ll show you some good horses. Guess
you and me can be friends anyway, eh!”</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp162">“Thank you,” replied Jack stiffly, “but I
guess I’ll stand with my friends, sir.</a> Perhaps
some day you’ll find out that we aren’t quite as
bad as you think us. I’m very much obliged
for the ride, Mr. Finkler.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” The farmer touched Dick with the
whip and the buggy whisked away up the road.
Jack stood a moment at the gate and looked
after it.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said to himself, “if I didn’t
make a mistake then. Maybe I’d have done
better if I’d stayed friends with him. But he
certainly is—is—exasperating!”</p>

<p class="cap">That settled the Peace Embassy.</p>

<p>When Jack narrated his talk with
Farmer Finkler to Dolph and Ted they
agreed unanimously that any further efforts at
securing the land would be wasted. Perhaps
Dolph was a little bit relieved at not having
to face the enemy. Certainly Prentiss and
Walker were when the news reached them.
Steve Walker even cut a caper.</p>

<p>“That’s a load off my mind,” he laughed.
“I’ve been dodging you for two weeks, Dolph,
for fear you’d grab me and lug me over there
to that ogre’s castle.”</p>

<p>“It was a wild dream from the start,” declared
Thorp Prentiss. “He’d have turned us
down, anyway. Probably set the dog on us!”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll just have to struggle along
with the field we’ve got,” mused Dolph.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” agreed Prentiss gloomily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
“If we only had a track we could have the Tri-Meet
next Spring for the asking. Well, this
is my last year. I’ve done the best I could and
if we get beaten as usual—which we naturally
will—it isn’t my fault. Only thing is, though,
that in another year or two we won’t have any
Track Team at all; fellows will get tired of always
being licked.”</p>

<p>“Benny ought to do something,” said Dolph
vaguely.</p>

<p>“I’d like to do something to old Finkler!”
growled Walker savagely. “Stubborn old
mule!”</p>

<p>“Think of his giving Borden a ride, though!”
marveled Prentiss. “That’s the wildest yarn
I ever heard. You don’t suppose he dreamed
it, do you?”</p>

<p>“Who? Jack Borden? No, he didn’t dream
it. Well, I’m off to practice. The Peace Embassy
is dissolved, fellows.”</p>

<p>June came in and the Tri-Meet was duly held
at Dixon Academy. As usual, Maple Ridge
ran a bad third, being totally eclipsed by both
her competitors in the track events, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
she made an excellent showing on the turf.
Chase won the meet, with Dixon a close second
and Maple Ridge last. Maple Ridge was not
disappointed or cast down for the simple reason
that she never expected to get better than
third place. A new captain was elected and
Thorp Prentiss handed over the reins of government
with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Baseball Team had been coming
strongly. Sam was pitching better and better
every time he was put in the box and his
support was steadying down wonderfully. Jack
was still spending much of his time on the bench
during the contests, although he usually got in
for two or three innings in right field or left.
His batting was getting more certain all the
time and as a pinch-hitter he was making something
of a reputation for himself. Mr. Shay
kept him at the net for half an hour at a time
every practice and Jack could not help but
profit by the work. In the field he was gradually
acquiring that ability to judge flies that he had
envied Tyler Wicks the possession of. He
learned to “size up” the batter; to know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to expect from a left-handed hitter; to judge
direction by the batter’s stand at the plate;
to tell by the sound of bat against ball
whether the hit was a long, hard one or one to
be handled by the infield. In short, he began to
develop very rapidly what Mr. Shay, the coach,
called “baseball sense.” But all this didn’t
give him the coveted position with the “regulars.”
He was still a utility man; substitute
outfielder and pinch-hitter. The difficulty was
that Jack had three good players in front of
him, all hard to displace. There was Tyler
Wicks in left field, and Tyler was a very good
man, not brilliant, but steady and dependable.
In right field Watkins was almost as good,
though more valuable as a batter than a fielder.
In centre Truesdale was all that could be desired.
As for the other substitutes, Jack was
already on an even footing with them; in fact,
he stood a little better in the estimation of Mr.
Shay and Dolph than any of them, possibly excepting
Joe Williams. And even Joe might
find himself out-distanced if Jack’s batting continued
to improve. Already the latter was hitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
close to .300, with only Ted and Dolph and
Truesdale ahead of him.</p>

<p>Maple Ridge lost the game with Mayport
Academy, on the latter’s grounds, the second
Saturday in June owing to what Sam called
“one grand slump.” Mort Prince, who started
the game for Maple Ridge, was batted out of
the box in the fourth inning when Mayport
through a combination of four safe hits and two
errors in the visitors’ infield tallied six runs.
After that Maple Ridge went to pieces. Hal
Morris took Prince’s place and was fairly effective
until the seventh. Then the enemy landed
on him fiercely, and when the dust of battle had
cleared away the score stood 14 to 4 in Mayport’s
favor, and Maple Ridge departed homewards
with their green banners trailing. There
were some who criticised Mr. Shay for not putting
Sam in instead of Morris. The more knowing
ones, however, pointed out that with the
whole team playing like a lot of children the
game was lost after the fourth and that it would
have been useless to put in Sam, especially as
he would be needed on Wednesday for the contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
with Springfield Preparatory, the last
game before the final one with Chase. Jack
vindicated his reputation as a pinch-hitter in
the Mayport fracas, batting for Prince in the
fifth inning and lining out a two-bagger. Unfortunately,
however, he was the first man up
and his hit brought no runs; and he never got
beyond third himself. In the seventh inning
he took Watkins’s place in right field, and although
he did no worse than any one else that
day he certainly failed to distinguish himself.
No errors were scored against him, but that
was due more to good luck than aught else, for
twice flies that he might have captured fell
safely to earth before he reached them. Once
he and Truesdale got into a mix-up where their
territories overlapped and the ball struck the
turf between them and Mayport tore off two
tallies.</p>

<p>Mr. Shay had very little to say either on the
way back to Charlemont or later. A slump is
something that is almost certain to happen to
the best regulated ball teams, and scolding seldom
helps much. The players had a lay-off on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Monday and a short, if sharp, practice on Tuesday.
The contest with Springfield Preparatory
School was not considered important, although
as Springfield had given Maple Ridge several
good drubbings in the past the Light Green was
naturally not averse to a victory. Whether the
team had recovered from its slump was a matter
of conjecture on Wednesday, and the school
was divided in prophecy, many predicting an
overwhelming defeat for Maple Ridge and others
foretelling a close victory.</p>

<p>The game was played at Springfield. Sam
was in the box for the visitors. From the second
inning the contest was a batting-fest, with
honors about even. Sam’s slants struck no terror
to the hearts of the home team and they
landed on them unerringly. On the other hand,
the Springfield pitcher fared no better, and
with two on bases in the third inning Gus Turnbull
brought the Maple Ridge supporters to
their feet by knocking out a home run that put
the Light Green in the lead. This lead was held
until the eighth, when Watkins muffed a long
fly and let in two runners. Shortly after that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Watkins pulled off his second error, allowing
a ball which he had been unable to reach in time
to catch to bound by him. It was clear that
Maple Ridge was still feeling the effects of
the slump, although convalescence had set in.
The infield made four errors, of which only one
proved costly, and Dolph had two passed balls
chalked against him when the game was over.
But in spite of this Maple Ridge triumphed by
inaugurating a batting rally in the first of the
ninth, tying the score with Truesdale’s sacrifice
fly that brought in Sam, and taking a two run
lead later, when, with two out, Ted, Dolph and
Cassart all hit safely. In the last of the inning
Maple Ridge tightened up and, although
Springfield got two men on bases, no runs were
scored, and Maple Ridge traveled home with a
10 to 8 victory tucked away.</p>

<p>Jack adorned the bench during the whole of
that game and it required all of Sam’s eloquence
to comfort and encourage him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, chum,” said Sam.
“You’ll get into the Chase game all right. I
wouldn’t be surprised if Shay put you in at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
right. Will certainly played like a lobster this
afternoon. Maybe we all did. I know I didn’t
have much on those chaps, and that’s a fact.
But Will was absolutely woozy; didn’t make a
single hit either, did he?”</p>

<p>“One,” replied Jack grudgingly.</p>

<p>“Did he? Well, anyway, I guess he’s dished.
I’m sorry, too, for I like Will, and he can play
good ball sometimes. I dare say Shay will put
you in right field on Monday. Then all
you’ve got to do is to play the game you can
play and you’ve got the position cinched for
Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Sounds easy the way you tell it,” replied
Jack with a smile, “but suppose I don’t play
the game I can play?”</p>

<p>Sam shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then
it’s a toss-up, I guess, between you and Will.
Anyway, you’ll get into the Chase game long
enough to get your letters.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care so much about my letters,” answered
Jack.</p>

<p>“You don’t? Why not? That’s what every
fellow wants, you goop! Think how swell you’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
look on Class Day with your M. R. on your
cap.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it will be too hot for caps,” laughed
Jack. “Can I put the letters on my straw?”</p>

<p>“It’s never too hot for caps that have M. R.
on them,” replied Sam. “Reminds me of a
story my dad tells. There used to be a man
in our town who was the glummest, sourest old
codger you ever saw. Never smiled in his life,
they say, until one day he got mixed up with
a street car and had two teeth knocked out.
The dentist put in two gold ones. After that
the old chap grinned all the time, just to show
his gold teeth, and grinning seemed to improve
his disposition wonderfully. He got quite
cheerful and sunny and folks got to liking him.
The only trouble was that he never got asked
to funerals because he couldn’t stop grinning!”</p>

<p>“That means, I suppose,” laughed Jack,
“that I’ve got to wear my cap all summer.
Not much, letters or no letters! I’d rather be
comfortable than stylish.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they all say,” responded Sam
knowingly, “until they get something to be stylish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
about. I dare say you’ll be like Pete Bates.
Pete won his football letters in his Junior year.
He got so fond of his sweater that he wore it
all the time. Some fellows say he even slept
in it! Anyway, he came into Talcott’s class
one morning with it on and Talcott got so mad
he reported him to Benny.”</p>

<p>Sam proved his ability as a prophet when on
Monday Jack went into right field in place of
Watkins, benched. For the rest of that week,
or as long as practice lasted, which was until
Thursday, Jack and Watkins fought for that
position like two bulldogs over a bone. On
Tuesday Watkins was given a chance to make
good again, but failed in a measure, probably
because he was too eager. On Wednesday Jack
went back and made a lamentable muff that
doubtless brought joy to the heart of Watkins.
On Thursday, the last day of work, Jack played
at right on the second team and Watkins came
into his own again. The other players and the
school at large watched the struggle with interest
and amusement and Jack and Watkins
each had his coterie of supporters. One thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
that made Jack hopeful of ultimate success
was the fact that at the bat he could more than
hold his own against his rival. Meanwhile the
two boys watched each other like duelists, maintained
the most courteous relations and waited
anxiously for coach and captain to give out the
line-up for the big game. Not until then would
they know who had won. But the line-up wasn’t
made public until the morning of the game, and
before that other things happened which, if
they had little bearing on the Chase game, at
least produced important results.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>AN ALARM OF FIRE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Maple Ridge and Chase were natural
rivals. The schools were similar
in character and size and had been
founded within five years of each other, whatever
advantage pertained to seniority belonging
to Chase. The rivalry was keen and healthy,
being founded on mutual respect and governed
by a spirit of justice. Each school struggled
hard every year to wrest from the other the
football, baseball and hockey supremacy, but
the best of feeling always prevailed. Some of
the other schools thereabouts, notably Dixon,
poked sly fun at the brotherly attitude displayed
by the rivals and told funny stories
about them, one being that when in their football
contests it became necessary for a Chase
man to tackle a Maple Ridge player, or vice
versa, the tackler invariably apologized profusely
beforehand for the liberty he was about
to take!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>When an athletic team from Chase visited
Maple Ridge it was entertained at dinner before
the contest, and the same thing happened
when Maple Ridge went to Chase. But in spite
of such amenities no two school teams battled
more determinedly for victory year after year.
And because Chase thought the Maple Ridge
students a fine lot of fellows and because Maple
Ridge respected Chase in the same way, a victory
over its rival was something for either to
be proud of and to celebrate gloriously. Save
in the matter of track and field sports, Chase
and Maple Ridge had always been pretty evenly
matched. During the period of athletic relationship,
which had begun almost with the beginning
of Maple Ridge School, Chase had captured
a majority of the football contests and
Maple Ridge had had the better of the baseball
arguments. Last year the Light Green
had defeated Chase on the diamond without
much difficulty, and, since it seldom happened
that either school won twice in succession, precedent
pointed now to a victory for the Brown.
But Dolph and his team weren’t bowing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
precedent. Dolph believed that this year’s
Maple Ridge team was better than last year’s.
Besides which Maple Ridge had the advantage
of playing on her own diamond. So Maple
Ridge went to bed on Friday night feeling
hopeful and cheerful, all thoughts fixed on the
morrow.</p>

<p>But it is one thing to go to bed and another
to sleep. So Jack discovered that night. There
had been no practice in the afternoon, which,
while it may have saved the players from becoming
tired or overtrained, left them at a loss
for occupation. Jack had found the time dragging
sadly. He and Sam and Chester Harris
had gone for a walk along the Ridge, but it
had been hot and close in the woods and they
had soon returned to school. For one he was
heartily glad when supper time arrived. Afterwards
some of the fellows had visited Number
12 for awhile and the next day’s game had been
threshed out most thoroughly until nine o’clock.
Mr. Shay had prescribed bed at half-past for
all players and substitutes, and Sam and Jack
obeyed the injunction. Sam had fallen off into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a sound slumber almost as soon as his head had
touched the pillow, for Sam had lived through
other nights before the battle and wasn’t troubled
much with nerves, anyway. But with Jack
it had been different. For the first hour he
had lain in bed with his eyes wide open and his
thoughts very busy with the morrow’s contest
and his chances of getting into it. His race
with Will Watkins for right field position had
got on his nerves until now it seemed that to
lose the prize would be a bigger disappointment
than he could stand. In the morning he would
have a saner view of it, but to-night, as he
threshed about on the bed, sleepless and flustered,
the one thing in life was to beat out
Watkins.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock sounded. By now he had
worked himself into a condition that made
slumber quite impossible. It was a warm night,
too, and his constant tossing about had made
him hot and uncomfortable. Near at hand was
the wide-open window. Disentangling himself
from the single sheet, which in his restlessness
had become wound around him like the wrappings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of a mummy, he crept out of bed as
quietly as possible, so as not to disturb Sam,
drew a chair to the window and, putting his
elbows on the ledge, leaned out into the cooler
night air. That was better. There was no
moon, but the stars were bright and he could
see the strip of lawn that stretched between
the back of South and the stone wall, beyond
which lay the Finkler orchard. The apple
trees had long since showered the ground with
their pink petals and now the leaves were well
out and the trees massed themselves darkly.
Yet between them, in the direction of the Finkler
house, a light shone, and Jack wondered
idly if any one were sick there or if the gruff
old farmer regularly kept such late hours.</p>

<p>There wasn’t a sound to be heard save at a
distance the incessant barking of a dog. The
night air cooled Jack’s hot head and his busy
brain quieted down. He was pondering the
idea of returning to bed when his attention was
attracted again to the light between the trees.
It had brightened and reddened and now it
showed above the orchard in an orange colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
glow. Could it be a fire? He looked intently
and listened. Once he thought he heard the
sound of shouting, but the barking of the dog
drowned all other sounds. Suddenly the glow
above the trees changed from orange to a dull,
ugly red and Jack could discern smoke and
sparks. With a bound he reached Sam’s bed
and shook that youth into waking.</p>

<p>“Sam, there’s a fire over here. Looks like
Finkler’s house. Come and look.”</p>

<p>Sam was out of bed in a second and leaning
across the sill at Jack’s side, rubbed his sleepy
eyes into service.</p>

<p>“Fire! I should say so! And that’s Finkler’s
place, sure as pop. There’s no other
house in that direction for a mile. Hoopla!
Me for the fire!”</p>

<p>Jack made a dash for his clothes, overturning
a chair.</p>

<p>“But can we go?” asked Jack excitedly.</p>

<p>“Sure! Get your things on. I’ll run down
and tell Talcott and he will give the alarm.”
Sam was hustling into his shirt and trousers
as he spoke, and the next instant he was out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of the room and hurrying down the stairs to
the Physical Director’s room on the first floor.
Jack found his clothes and got into them
hastily, watching meanwhile the glow above the
orchard. Every moment it grew and brightened.
Sam came running back.</p>

<p>“Where are my shoes?” he gasped. “Talcott
says we can go ahead, Jack. Are you
dressed? There goes the alarm!”</p>

<p>At the head of the staircase the big fire gong
was pealing lustily and doors were being
thrown open up and down the corridor.</p>

<p>“Come on!” shouted Sam. “Grab a bucket
in the lower hall. The others will follow. Talcott
says he will send the extinguishers around
by the road. That’s Finkler’s as sure as fighting!”</p>

<p>The next moment, evading the excited questions
flung at them from open doorways, the
two boys dashed downstairs, seized each a red
bucket from the rack and sped across the lawn
toward the orchard. Shoes and trousers and
shirts constituted their attire, and getting
through the barberry hedge that lined the wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
was a painful operation. But once over and in
the orchard the way was easy. They headed
straight for the glow of the fire, dodging the
trees, but stumbling over an occasional root.
They didn’t try to talk, but saved their breath
for running. Jack could have outdistanced
Sam, who had a good deal more weight to
carry, but he resisted his impatience and kept
with his chum. Presently the orchard thinned
and then they were out of it, with only a little
expanse of turf and garden between them and
the fire.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the house,” gasped Jack. “It’s beyond.
See?”</p>

<p>“Stable or something,” answered Sam, plodding
breathlessly along. “We’ve beat the other
fellows, all right!”</p>

<p>The scene was as light as day. The big
white house stood out stark against a glow of
flame and a welter of smoke. Upward ascended
a stream of sparks that floated a moment in
the still air high up against the tops of the big
elms. In the glare several persons were visible;
Farmer Finkler himself, two of his men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and, near the door of the house, his daughter.
Beside her, Rowdy, the dog, his nose in air,
was protesting loudly at the unaccustomed proceedings.
The farmer and his men were plainly
in a condition of panic, for, although a garden
hose lay on the ground spouting water no one
made any attempt to direct it against the
flames. The farmer held a bucket, but the fire
had grown so hot that buckets were no longer
practical, since it was impossible to get near
enough to the flames to throw water on them.
As Jack and Sam ran up the farmer saw them.</p>

<p>“Seen the engines?” he shouted hoarsely
above the roar and crackle of the flames. “Are
they coming?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir,” answered Sam. “We
ran across from school. The rest will be here
in a minute with buckets. Guess all you can do,
though, is to keep the house from going.”</p>

<p>“Buckets don’t do any good,” replied Mr.
Finkler, tossing his aside as he spoke. “I telephoned
for the engines ten minutes ago. Why
don’t they come?”</p>

<p>“It’s two miles,” said Jack, “and I guess it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
will take them some time. I hope you have insurance,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Insurance? On the buildings, of course, I
have! But there ain’t any on my horses. Why
don’t the engines come?”</p>

<p>Beyond the house, at the side, was an open
woodshed some thirty feet long which connected
with a small stable. This was nowadays used
only as a carriage house. Beyond that again,
with only a narrow cart-way between, stood the
big barn that was the farmer’s pride and delight.
The land sloped here and the lower floor
of the structure, reached from the back, was
used for the cows and for storage. The main
floor, with entrances from the front and further
end, held the horse stalls, harness room,
grain bins and farming implements and machinery.
Above were lofts for hay. It was the
small carriage house that was in flames, and
even as the boys looked the roof crashed in
with a mighty spouting of sparks. On one side
the roof of the woodshed was ablaze and on
the other the end of the big barn was blistering
and here and there little tongues of flame were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
already working in and out. Jack seized the
hose and pulling it toward the shed played the
water on the roof. By that time the rest of
the boys from school began to arrive, and with
them Mr. Talcott. The latter took command
of the situation in a minute. A ladder was
found and three boys were sent to the woodshed
roof. Others formed a bucket line from
the hydrant in front of the house and water
was passed to the boys on the roof. The hose
was directed against the end of the barn in an
endeavor to keep that wet until the engines
arrived. Luckily there was a good water supply
from a tower tank a little distance back
of the stable which was filled by means of a
gasoline engine from the brook at the foot of
the Ridge. Farmer Finkler was induced to
send one of his men across to the engine house
and start the pump up. The two chemical extinguishers
arrived by way of the road and
streams from those were directed against the
barn. Meanwhile the cows on the lower level
were being got out by a number of the boys
working under the direction of a farm hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>To remove the horses, however, was more of
a problem, for the main door to the stable floor
was at the corner next to the burning carriage
house and the flames rendered entrance there
well-nigh impossible. Had the big swinging
door been open, or even unlocked, it would have
been possible to dash through, but it was secured
with a padlock and no one could have
stayed there long enough to use the key. So
far, however, Mr. Talcott’s fire brigade had
kept the barn from catching, and if the engines
from Charlemont arrived soon it was probable
that the big building could be saved. But the
chemical extinguishers were soon exhausted and
only the hose was left. As by that time the
woodshed roof was pretty well wet down, Mr.
Talcott ordered some of the boys to the high
sloping roof of the stable. It was risky work,
but there were plenty of volunteers, and the
big ladder was placed against the side of the
barn and half a dozen boys swarmed up it. A
new bucket line was formed and the red pails
were passed from hand to hand up the ladder
and along the sloping roof and the water was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
thrown on the smoking shingles. Luckily most
of the boys wore rubber-soled “sneakers,”
which helped them to keep their feet. Detailing
a number of boys to keep watch on the
woodshed and the house, Mr. Talcott found
Mr. Finkler.</p>

<p>“This is most unfortunate, sir,” he said.
“But I think we can keep things safe until the
fire department arrives. At least, I don’t
think you need worry about the house, Mr.
Finkler.”</p>

<p>“The house!” shouted the farmer. “Let it
go! It’s the barn we’ve got to save, sir! I’ve
got nineteen horses in there, some of the finest
horses in this state, sir! Why don’t those
engines come?”</p>

<p>“They must get here pretty soon now,” answered
Mr. Talcott. “Meanwhile I think we
can hold our own. That small building will
burn itself out pretty soon.” He shielded his
eyes from the heat and glare and looked toward
it. “The second floor is about ready to tumble
in now. Don’t you think, however, it would be
best to get your horses out of the barn?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would if I knew a way,” cried the farmer.
“But that’s the only door except the hay door
at the other end, and Joe has the key, and he’s
away to-night. And if we break open the hay
door we can’t get the horses out there. There’s
a wall between.”</p>

<p>“This door here is locked?”</p>

<p>“Tight. Here’s the key.” Mr. Finkler
opened his hand and displayed it. “I tried to
get to it, but the heat beat me back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s out of the question. Even if it
was open I doubt if any one could get in now.
I’ll have a look at the other door you speak of.
You have axes handy?”</p>

<p>“Will’s got one. The others are in the
barn.”</p>

<p>At that moment there came cries of alarm
from the boys on the roof and Mr. Talcott hurried
toward the ladder.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he called.</p>

<p>“It’s on fire inside, sir! The flames are coming
up through the roof on the back!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE BATTING LIST</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Mr. Talcott stooped, unlaced his
shoes and kicked them off. Then
he sprang up the ladder and joined
the boys on the barn roof. Sure enough, the
flames were pouring through venomously.
Doubtless a stray spark had found lodgment
there and had eaten its way through to the hay
inside. Mr. Talcott watched a moment. Then
he shook his head.</p>

<p>“All down from here, fellows,” he said.
“We can’t stop that.”</p>

<p>“With a hose, sir, we might hold it,” said
Joe Cassart.</p>

<p>“We haven’t one long enough. Get down
the ladder in a hurry, boys; the hay is probably
on fire underneath us this minute.”</p>

<p>When they reached the ground Mr. Finkler
was acting like a madman. Once he made a
dash at the door, but the heat sent him reeling
back, gasping and blinded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“My horses!” he shouted wildly. “My
horses! Get them out! Why don’t the engines
come?”</p>

<p>Mr. Talcott gathered a dozen of the boys together
and hurried to the door at the end of
the barn. This was reached by a sloping drive
and was big enough to admit a loaded hay-rick.
The two big sliding doors were tightly secured
from inside and a hunt for the axe was begun.
Will, the farm hand, was soon found, but what
he had done with the axe he couldn’t remember.
Finally it was discovered outside the cow door
and Mr. Talcott set to work with it. Those
doors were strongly built, though, and it was
some time before an entrance was effected.
When the shattered doors were pushed back
the interior was already foul with smoke, while
above them the flames were licking greedily at
the great piles of hay.</p>

<p>“Look for some way into the stable end,”
shouted Mr. Talcott as they rushed in. The
middle of the floor was clear, but on either
side stood hay-ricks, wagons, mowing machines
and such. A wooden partition divided this end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of the barn from the stable beyond and never a
door was to be found.</p>

<p>“The man that designed this barn must have
been an idiot,” muttered Mr. Talcott as he
searched about in the smoke and dim glare.
“See anything, Phillips?”</p>

<p>“There’s a small window here, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s no good to us. How do you suppose
they get hay to the horses?” he asked
disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Probably shove it down through chutes
from above, sir,” suggested Jack. “Give me a
leg-up, Sam, and I’ll have a peek through the
window.”</p>

<p>Sam obeyed.</p>

<p>“All dark the other side, sir,” Jack reported.
He pulled his elbow back and sent it crashing
against the window. There was a shower of
glass and Jack pressed his face to the opening.
“The horses are there, sir. I can see them;
hear them, too; the poor things are frightened
to death.”</p>

<p>“What’s under the window?” asked Mr. Talcott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t see, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right; down with you. Look out!”</p>

<p>The axe bit into the planks. In the physical
director’s hands an axe was a very business-like
instrument and in a moment he had cleared an
opening through which it was possible to crawl.</p>

<p>“May I go, sir?” asked Jack eagerly.</p>

<p>“All right. See where you——”</p>

<p>“Whoa, boy! It’s a stall, sir. Be careful of
the horse. He’s kicking up a bit.”</p>

<p>“Stay in there and keep out of the way, Borden,
while I make this hole bigger. We may
have to come back this way.”</p>

<p>The axe got to work again and then Mr. Talcott,
followed by nearly a dozen boys, crept
through. The stalls were arranged in two rows
across the width of the big building. Between
them was a space some twelve feet wide. The
horses were in a panic, snorting with fear,
tugging at their halters and plunging from side
to side in the stalls.</p>

<p>“Keep out of the way of hoofs, boys!” sang
out Mr. Talcott as he groped his way to the
door at the front. The acrid smoke was less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
thick here, but it was bad enough, and it got
into their eyes and throats until they wept and
choked. Outside they could hear the roar and
crackle of the flames and inside the heat was
becoming almost unbearable. Mr. Talcott
reached the door and once more the axe swung.
About him the boys clustered, holding arms
before their faces or wiping their eyes of the
tears that streamed out. Suddenly there was
a flash of red light as the door gave and the
next moment Mr. Talcott had thrown it wide
open, retreating quickly before the blast of
heat that entered.</p>

<p>“Now for the horses!” he shouted. “Climb
over the sides from stall to stall. If you have
knives, cut the halters and drive them out.
Phillips, you stand here and hustle them along.
But look out for hoofs. Now then, quick’s the
word, boys!”</p>

<p>With a cheer they began their work. Most
of the fellows had knives in their pockets and
as fast as a halter rope was slashed the halter
was seized and the horse was forced out into
the runway. It was wild work, for the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
animals, maddened by fright, refused in some
cases to do anything but stand in the stalls and
plunge about. In the midst of it there was a
terrific crash overhead.</p>

<p>“There comes some of the roof,” said Mr.
Talcott cheerfully. “Come on, fellows! Get
busy! Get up, there! Out you go! Send him
along, Phillips.”</p>

<p>Sam had found a pitchfork and with the
handle of it he belabored the horses as they
reached the corner. And it took plenty of
urging to get them to face that glare and heat
at the doorway. But, with Sam showing no
mercy behind, they all went through, and in
scarcely more time than it has taken to tell it
the stalls were empty and Farmer Finkler’s
horses were galloping off into the darkness.</p>

<p>“That’s all, sir!” shouted Jack from the end
of the line of stalls.</p>

<p>“Good work! Come on now! Cover your
faces, boys, and make a dash for it. There’s
no use trying to get out where we came in.
Ready? Now run!”</p>

<p>The heat smote them like a blow from some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
giant hand as with closed eyes and covered
faces they dashed through the doorway, but
they got out safely and reached the shelter of
the trees across the driveway. Cheers from the
others met them as they gained safety. And
when from there they looked back at the barn
they realized that they had left it none too
soon, for it was in flames from end to end and
the great crimson and orange tongues were
leaping ten feet high along the ridge-pole. A
sudden clanging of gongs sounded from down
the drive and an engine, hose-cart and hook-and-ladder
swung into view. At the same instant
the carriage-house subsided in a wreck
of charred and flaming timbers and the nearer
end of the barn roof disappeared with a loud
crash.</p>

<p>An hour later Maple Ridge went home to bed,
if not to sleep. By that time the fire was under
control. The carriage-house and barn were
total losses, but the woodshed and residence
were safe, as well as the water-tower and several
smaller structures near it. As the boys
trooped down the lane, their extinguishers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
tow, the light from the fire followed them, casting
grotesque shadows ahead. And above the
jarring of the engine and the hiss of water
came the incessant barking of Rowdy!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have said that Maple Ridge went home to
bed, if not to sleep. Naturally, after such a
night of adventure and excitement sleep was
very far from the thoughts of most of the boys,
and both North and South Dormitories discussed
the events for a long time after the last
light was out. But there was one boy who
spent little time in conversation, and that was
Jack. It seemed as though an hour of a fireman’s
life was just what he needed to quiet
his nerves! By the time he and Sam were back
in their room Jack was nodding, and, although
Sam would gladly have talked for a long time,
Jack fell asleep quickly and soundly, in spite
of the fact that his right hand, surreptitiously
wrapped in a dampened handkerchief, was
smarting and throbbing under the pillow.</p>

<p>Saturday dawned clear and hot, with scarcely
any breeze stirring the leaves of the trees on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the campus. It was a morning when hot coffee
looked supremely distasteful, when appetites
proved capricious and the clink of ice in the big
water pitchers was music to the ear. As Gus
Turnbull remarked when, breakfast over, a
number of the fellows made themselves comfortable
in the shade in front of North, it “only
needed a silly locust up there somewhere to
make it August.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be some hot for the game this
afternoon,” observed Steve Walker, plucking
a particularly juicy grass-blade and inserting
it between his teeth.</p>

<p>“Lucky if it doesn’t rain,” said Tyler Wicks,
casting a knowing look at the dazzling blue sky
above the tree-tops.</p>

<p>“There’s sure to be a thunder-storm.” This
from Midget Green, cross-legged at the edge of
the group and as near Ted Warner as he could
get.</p>

<p>“What do you know about it, kid?” asked
Milton Wales, tossing a pebble at him.</p>

<p>Midget caught the missile deftly and shook
it between closed hands. “I do know,” he answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
“You always have a thunder-storm
on a day like this. You—you can feel it in the
air.”</p>

<p>“Midget’s rheumatism is troubling him,”
suggested Ted gravely. “Any one seen Dolph
since breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he and Shay are up there; I guess
they’re making out the batting list,” answered
Harry Smythe, nodding his head in the general
direction of the upper floor of North.</p>

<p>A silence followed this announcement. Jack
and Watkins each strove to look indifferent
and only succeeded in appearing very self-conscious.</p>

<p>“Guess we won’t know it until just before
the game, will we, Ted?” asked Smythe with
a yawn. He had not gone to sleep until after
three in the morning and was feeling the effects
of his dissipation.</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” replied Ted. “Who’s got
a ball?”</p>

<p>Midget made a convulsive sound, threw himself
back until his feet were in air and produced
one from his trousers pocket after much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
struggling. “Take mine,” he said breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Thanks. Want to pass, Harry?”</p>

<p>Harry shook his head. “Not much. I’m
going to sleep.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Will Watkins. The two moved
over to the gravel and began throwing the ball
back and forth.</p>

<p>“Who wants some tennis?” asked Gus Turnbull.</p>

<p>“I’ll play you, Gus,” said Tyler Wicks.</p>

<p>But Ted overheard and interposed sternly.
“You’ll do nothing of the kind, you idiots.
Shay told us to keep quiet this morning. You’ll
be all done up if you play tennis in this heat.”</p>

<p>“Well, gee,” grumbled Gus. “I can’t sit
around like this all the morning.”</p>

<p>“Get a book and read,” Ted suggested.</p>

<p>“It’s too hot to read,” grunted Gus. The
others laughed. Wicks sat up and fished in his
pocket for his knife.</p>

<p>“I’ll amuse you, Gus,” he said. “Crawl
over here and we’ll play stick-knife.”</p>

<p>“Stick-knife!” jeered Gus. “Why not jack-stones?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
But nevertheless he joined Tyler
and the two were soon hard at it. One by one
the fellows left and the group lessened until
only the players, Jack and Steve Walker remained.</p>

<p>“Think you’ll play?” asked Walker, lowering
his voice.</p>

<p>Jack shook his head. “I don’t believe so,”
he replied. “Not start the game, that is.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with your hand?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; just scorched it a bit last night.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see.”</p>

<p>But Jack didn’t disturb the handkerchief
around it. Instead he thrust it into his pocket,
where he had been keeping it most of the time.
“There isn’t anything to see,” he answered.
“It’s just—sort of red.”</p>

<p>Walker eyed him narrowly and shrugged his
shoulders. “Better get it attended to if you
expect to play,” he said. “Too bad it isn’t the
other hand. Then you could have padded your
glove a bit. How’d you do it?”</p>

<p>“Took hold of a piece of hot iron,” replied
Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guess you dropped it in a hurry,” said
Walker with a grin. “Say, Borden, I think
we were pretty good to that old rascal last
night. Seems to me after what we did for him
he ought to come off his high horse and be
decent about that piece of land we want.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too, but Sam says he’s more
likely to prosecute us for trespassing!”</p>

<p>“That’s not bad,” laughed Walker, “and I
dare say that’s what he will do. Well, I’m off.
Hope you get into the game, Borden.”</p>

<p>After he was gone Jack drew his hand from
his pocket, unwrapped the handkerchief and
examined his wound. It looked pretty ugly, for
the blisters had broken and the flesh underneath
was red and inflamed. The only thing
Jack had found to apply was peroxide of hydrogen.
Sam had a bottle of that and Jack
had filched a little before breakfast when Sam
wasn’t looking. Jack didn’t want even Sam
to know about his burn; it was best to be on
the safe side. If it got to Dolph’s ears or to
Shay’s they might make a lot of it and not let
him play. Of course it <em>did</em> hurt, but then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
wasn’t anything to interfere with his catching
or batting. Meanwhile, he concluded, he would
go back to the room and if Sam wasn’t there
put some more peroxide on it.</p>

<p>Dinner for the nine and substitutes that day
was a half-hour earlier than usual, for the game
was to start at two-fifteen. Every fellow made
a good pretence of eating heartily, but few of
them really consumed enough food to satisfy
a healthy baby. The heat continued, although
there seemed a little more breeze stirring than
earlier in the day, and many anxious looks
were cast at the sky. But the thunder clouds
didn’t materialize. At a little after one the
Towners and their friends began to arrive and
at half-past the nine went to the gymnasium
to get into their togs. Dolph was looking a
bit pale and acting fidgety, and Mr. Shay was
very quiet and earnest. When the fellows
were ready for the field he called them around
him and made a little speech. It was quite the
usual thing, only it sounded a deal more important
to-day, and the fellows listened very
quietly to it. And when he had finished he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
took his little red memorandum book from his
pocket.</p>

<p>“Here’s the batting-list for the game, boys,”
he announced. “Warner, first base; Smythe,
shortstop; Jones, catcher; Truesdale, center
field; Borden, right field; Turnbull, second
base; Cassart, third base; Wicks, left field;
Phillips, pitcher. All right now; come on!”</p>

<p>As they made for the door Sam thumped
Jack on the back.</p>

<p>“O you Kansas!” he chuckled.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>A GARRISON FINISH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was not until the beginning of the second
inning that anything happened, although
in the first Chase got a runner to first
on a single. But Ted threw him out at second
when he tried to steal, and the next two went
out easily. Maple Ridge retired in order. In
the second inning Brothers, Chase’s second
baseman, singled to right, went to second on a
neat sacrifice and got third when Sam made
his only error of the game, a poor throw to
second in the hope of catching the runner off
base. The next batter went out on an infield
fly, and with two down Maple Ridge breathed
easier. Out in right field Jack pulled his cap
further over his face to keep the broiling sun
out of his eyes, shifted a few steps to the left
as the next batsman faced the pitcher, and
waited. Two balls went by and then there was
a hard, solid <em>crack</em> and the ball was arching out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
toward him, high against the glaring sky. He
ran back a few yards, turned, faced and waited.
Down came the ball and up went Jack’s hands.</p>

<p>Then there was a groan from the Maple
Ridge partisans and a yell of joy from the
enemy, and Jack was picking the ball from the
turf and heaving it despairingly to second,
while the man from third was trotting across
the plate with the first tally. Jack had forgotten
his injured hand, and when the ball had
struck the involuntary flinch that followed had
let it trickle out of his grasp. How he hated
himself! He had had his chance to make good
and lost it! How they must be reviling him
up there on the stand. Gus Turnbull, though,
was calling to him hearteningly:</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Kansas! Cheer up!”</p>

<p>But there was no cheering up for Jack just
then. It had been the worst muff he had ever
made. Even in the first days of learning he
had never done anything quite so atrocious.
He glowered at his raw palm and deliberately
struck it with his clenched mitt. The pain was
bad for a moment, and almost brought the tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to his eyes, but he told himself he deserved far
more than that. Of course they would pull
him out now and put Watkins back. Well, it
was his own fault. To drop an easy fly like
that!</p>

<p>Meanwhile the next batsman was up and the
man on second was dancing up and down and
back and forth, daring Sam to throw to the base.
But Sam refused to pay any attention to him.
Instead he set to work to strike out Clifford,
the Chase pitcher, and soon succeeded.</p>

<p>Jack trotted back to the bench feeling like a
murderer, but strangely enough he met only
amused smiles or sympathetic grins as he
squeezed into retirement between Sam and
Tyler Wicks, and if Shay meant to take him out
he said nothing about it then nor later. But
Will Watkins, seated further along amongst the
substitutes, looked hopeful.</p>

<p>That one run lead Chase maintained for inning
after inning. Maple Ridge got men on
bases several times, and only Ted got to third,
but always the hit needed to bring in a run
was lacking. Clifford was pitching good ball,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for, although Maple Ridge got as many hits as
her adversary, they were scattered, and the
Chase fielders refused to make errors. In the
fourth inning Chase again looked dangerous
when Gibson singled to right, took second on a
sacrifice hit and third on an infield out. But
he died there, for Sam fanned the next batsman.
Again, in the eighth, Chase threatened to
add to that single tally of hers. Sam passed
the first man up, the second was safe when
Smythe fumbled a fast grounder, and both
moved up on a sacrifice. But again Sam settled
down and pitched perfect ball and Gibson
and Brothers struck out.</p>

<p>And all this time Maple Ridge was doing her
best to slip in a run to tie the score, and always
fate was against her. Clifford grew stronger
as the game progressed and in the seventh and
eighth innings not a Maple Ridge player saw
first. The gloom thickened fast. In the first
of the ninth Chase was all for starting a batting
rally and the coaches made more noise than
two steam calliopes, but Sam was still going
strong. The first man was an easy out, Smythe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to Ted, the second flied out to Truesdale and
the third never left the plate, falling victim to
Sam’s elusive slants.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows!” cried Dolph as they
trotted to the bench. “Last chance, you know.
Here’s where we pull in a couple.” But in
spite of his hopeful words Dolph looked pretty
tired and nervous and dispirited. The Maple
Ridge supporters were on their feet, cheering
loudly as Ted, the head of the list, stepped to
bat. Down at first Truesdale danced around
in the coacher’s box and shouted encouragement,
and back of third Joe Williams, who had
a voice like a fog-horn, was waving and yelling.</p>

<p>Ted struck twice and missed, waited and got
the benefit of three balls and then let go at a
high, straight one. The ball trickled erratically
half-way to the pitcher’s box. Pitcher and
catcher ran for it, jostled confusedly and allowed
Ted to reach first in safety. Then the
cheering began in earnest! Midget Green was
seen standing on his head in front of the stand,
and they say it took him almost all of Sunday
afternoon to recover the treasures that dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
from his pockets. Smythe, whose batting had
been poor all the afternoon, was taken out and
Dick Furst went in to bat for him. Furst
managed to connect with the second offer and
sent Ted to second, going out himself at first.
When Dolph stepped up to the plate surely
even Rome never heard such howling! Now
was the time for Dolph to make good with one
of his three-baggers. But alas for reputation!
Dolph, nervous and over-anxious, struck at
some of the worst balls Clifford had in his
repertoire and finally fanned himself out.</p>

<p>Two gone and the score still one to nothing
against them! It was all over! Maple Ridge
stuffed its score-cards in its pockets, settled
its hats and prepared for the exodus. But
perhaps Truesdale didn’t share the general pessimism
as he selected his bat and strode to the
rubber, for he faced Clifford confidently and
smilingly.</p>

<p>“Last man!” shouted Brothers, the Chase
second baseman. “Two gone, Bob; let him
hit it!”</p>

<p>Had Brothers, who had fielded his position in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
masterly style all the afternoon without an
error, known what was about to happen, he
wouldn’t have spoken so cheerfully. For
Truesdale, after having a strike and two balls
called on him, picked out something he liked
and slammed it hard toward second baseman.
In streaked Ted and down the line flew Truesdale.
Brothers took the grounder on the
bound, dropped it, kicked it and finally, when
he had it safe in hand again, Truesdale was
on first, the score was tied and the Maple
Ridgers were howling and shouting like lunatics,
dancing over the grass and thumping each
other anywhere and everywhere. The light
green flags waved frantically, and the spectators
threatened to put an end to the game then and
there by overflowing the diamond and carrying
off the Maple Ridge players.</p>

<p>Meanwhile consternation had seized the visiting
team, consternation and fright. Brothers,
after slamming his glove to the ground and
begging shortstop to kick him—something
shortstop looked very willing to do—joined the
pitcher and third baseman in a consultation at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the mound. What they said or planned I can’t
say. Certainly, though, Clifford was no longer
the same fellow who had held Maple Ridge
scoreless and helpless for eight innings. He
was palpably nervous as the others went back
to their positions.</p>

<p>“Pick out a good one, Borden,” said Mr.
Shay calmly as Jack selected his bat. “It only
takes one, you know.”</p>

<p>And Jack, his hand paining him badly,
gripped that bat and made up his mind to retrieve
himself.</p>

<p>Clifford sent a high ball and the crowd yelled
its delight. He followed that with a wild one
that the catcher just managed to get. “Two
balls,” said the umpire. Maple Ridge danced
with glee. Then Clifford and the catcher talked
it over half-way between mound and plate, and
the catcher patted him on the shoulder and the
pitcher worked a very pretty drop on Jack at
the next delivery.</p>

<p>In the meantime Truesdale, at first, was anxious
to get down to second, and on the next
pitch he started. Luckily for him the ball was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
a low drop and by the time the catcher had
straightened out for the throw he was sliding
for the bag. More cheers from the home team’s
friends. The score was one strike and three
balls. Jack made up his mind to give Clifford
an opportunity of passing him, but Clifford
didn’t intend to do anything of the sort. The
next delivery, at which Jack made no motion,
was another strike, and it was now or never.
Jack took a fresh grip at the bat and glued
his eyes to the ball.</p>

<p>Clifford, fighting against nervousness, was
very deliberate, eyeing batsman and base-runner
alternately. At last he wound up, straightened
out and the ball sped toward the plate.
It looked straight and good, and, since it was
the crucial delivery, Jack believed it would
prove such when it reached him. And it did.
And <a href="#i_fp212">Jack met it squarely with a good, sharp
<em>crack</em></a> and raced for first!</p>

<p>Three feet from the ground sped the ball, two
feet inside the third base line, four feet from
the fielder’s frantic effort to reach it, a fine
straight base hit that rolled clear to the outfield.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Truesdale, taking no chances, slid the last
ten feet of his journey to the plate, was caught
up by frenzied admirers and borne off the field.
For the game was over, with the final score
2 to 1! Maple Ridge, in a garrison finish, had
won out in the ninth!</p>

<small>FINKLER’S FIELD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That evening, according to custom, the
nine banqueted in the New Dining
Hall behind tightly closed doors. The
New Dining Hall was not as grand as its name
sounded, being only a smaller room opening
from the main hall and used chiefly at graduation
time to accommodate the overflow of visiting
relatives and friends. The banquet was the
regular school supper, with the substitution of
steak for cold meats and the addition of ice
cream and cake. But it isn’t food alone that
constitutes a banquet; without companionship
and good spirits the most elaborate repast in
the world fails to deserve that title. To-night
good spirits were rampant, and companionship
was a drug on the market, for hadn’t they all
worked together for three months with just
one end in view, and hadn’t that end been attained?
Dolph said something to that effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in his speech and the affirmative answer was
so loud and enthusiastic that the boys in the
main dining hall laughed in sympathy and
cheered joyously, an infraction of the regulations
which the instructors forebore to notice.</p>

<p>The banquet was practically over; only Sam
and Joe Williams still nibbled with fast failing
courage at their third helpings of ice cream;
the speeches had been made and the only formality
remaining was the election of a new
captain. But there was no hurry about that.
Every one of the twenty-two boys who lined
the two long tables were supremely contented.
I was going to say supremely comfortable, but
Sam’s countenance was assuming an expression
rendering the selection of that word inadvisable.
At the head of one of the tables sat
Dolph, at the head of the other Mr. Shay. The
coach leaned back in his chair resisting nobly,
in deference to a rule of deportment which he
knew of but was not in the habit of heeding, a
desire to bring into use the toothpick reposing
in his vest pocket. Mr. Shay was not in sympathy
with the ban on the public display of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that useful implement, but he believed in the
wisdom of the advice, “When in Rome do as
the Romans do.” As Rome wasn’t using toothpicks
this evening, he sighed and heroically removed
his fingers from tempting contact. Sam
finally laid down his spoon, gazed wistfully at
the remaining portion of ice cream and gave
his attention to the conversation going on
around him.</p>

<p>“Three errors was all we made,” Milton
Wales was declaring emphatically. “And
Chase made four.”</p>

<p>“We each made four,” corrected Gus Turnbull.
“I don’t think that’s so bad, though, do
you, Mr. Shay?”</p>

<p>“No, but it’s four too many.”</p>

<p>“Where do you get four?” asked Wales impatiently.
“You made one and Harry made
one——”</p>

<p>“I sure did,” groaned Smythe.</p>

<p>“And Jack Borden made one. Where’s your
fourth?”</p>

<p>“Sam’s wild throw to second,” answered
Gus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Call that an error?” asked Tyler Wicks.</p>

<p>“Sure. It advanced the runner, didn’t it?
How about it, Chesty?”</p>

<p>“Four errors,” answered Manager Harris,
speaking from the authority of official scorer.
“We won just the same, so what’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“Of course, mine was an error,” said Sam.
“And a bum one, too. But there was one error
made that hardly ought to be called an
error.”</p>

<p>“Which was that?” asked Mr. Shay curiously.</p>

<p>“Jack Borden’s, sir; when he dropped that
fly.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d call that an error,” said the
coach, “especially since it let in a run.”</p>

<p>“I know, but what I mean is that Jack had a
good reason for not catching it. Show Mr.
Shay your hand, Jack.”</p>

<p>But Jack shook his head, smiling shamefacedly.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the others. “What’s the
matter, Borden? Hurt it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“A little,” owned Jack. “I—I burned it at
the fire last night.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see!”</p>

<p>So Jack held it up for inspection and a murmur
of surprise and sympathy went around the
table. Dolph opened his eyes very wide. Mr.
Shay frowned.</p>

<p>“I should say you had burned it,” said the
latter dryly. “Did you know that, Jones?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did not, sir!” responded Dolph.
“Didn’t you know, Jack, we wouldn’t have let
you play if we’d known your hand was in that
shape?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the reason I didn’t say anything
about it,” answered Jack naïvely, producing a
burst of laughter. “I could have caught that
ball all right if I’d just remembered my hand,
Dolph. But when I saw the ball coming I forgot,
and when it landed it—it hurt like the
dickens and before I could squeeze it it had
bounced out.”</p>

<p>“You might have lost us the game,” said
Dolph reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, cut out the post mortems,” begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Ted. “Don’t forget that Jack’s hit brought in
the winning run. Besides, you want to remember
that Jack had been fighting for right field
for a week and he knew if he showed that hand
around his hated rival would get the job.” Ted
smiled across at Will Watkins.</p>

<p>“I guess I would have, too,” said Watkins
with a grin. “I’d have done just what Borden
did, you bet!”</p>

<p>There was another laugh at this frank confession
and then Dolph suggested that they get
busy with the election. It was the custom to
elect to the captaincy a fellow who would be
in his senior year, which narrowed the list of
candidates to three: Sam Phillips, Harry
Smythe and George Truesdale. Dolph as retiring
captain had the privilege of making the
first nomination.</p>

<p>“There are three first team fellows,” he
said, “any one of whom would make a good
leader for next year. They have all worked
hard and all have contributed to the team’s
success this year and last. But there’s one of
the three who has done a little more than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
others, a chap who has got us out of many a
tight hole, a chap who is always cheerful and
jolly, always cool-headed—no matter if the
bases are full with none out!—a chap whom we
all like and admire and respect and one who,
I believe, will make as good a captain as Maple
Ridge has ever had. Fellows, I have the honor
and pleasure to nominate Sam Phillips.”</p>

<p>Every one clapped and cheered, and the nomination
was vociferously seconded. Sam, with
reddened cheeks, seized his spoon and began
anew on the ice cream. Ted, laughing, took the
plate away from him. Gus Turnbull claimed
recognition.</p>

<p>“Without wishing to say a word against
Sam, for Sam is all Dolph says he is—and
more—I want to propose for the captaincy a
fellow who has played on the team for three
years and who has always worked hard and
deserves recognition for—for his services. I
nominate George Truesdale.”</p>

<p>More applause. “I second the nomination,”
said Wales.</p>

<p>Then Morton Prince nominated Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Smythe, and Smythe jumped to his feet. “I
decline,” he said. “Much obliged, but I decline.
I’m not the sort to be captain. I’d be
scared to death, for one thing. I—I never
could look haughty enough, you know, and
you’ve simply got to look haughty, fellows.
Leave me out, please.” And Harry sat down
amidst laughter.</p>

<p>“Are there any other nominations?” asked
Dolph. “If not we’ll take a vote.”</p>

<p>“Vote!” was the cry.</p>

<p>“Then those in favor of Phillips will arise
and those in favor of Truesdale will remain
seated!”</p>

<p>There was a scraping of chairs as sixteen of
the fellows arose, Truesdale with them. Dolph
counted them.</p>

<p>“Sixteen for Phillips and six for Truesdale,”
he announced. “Phillips is elected.”</p>

<p>A shout went up and the fellows crowded
about Sam to shake his hand or thump him on
the back. Truesdale demanded attention.</p>

<p>“I move that the election be made unanimous,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Gus Turnbull promptly seconded the motion.
Then Harry Smythe demanded a cheer for Sam,
which was given lustily, and one for Dolph, to
which the response was no less hearty, and then
one “for Maple Ridge, fellows, and make it
good!”</p>

<p>And just as the last long-drawn-out
“School!” had died away there was a polite
knock at the folding doors and Dick Furst
threw them open. On the threshold stood Dr.
Benedict and a tall man in loose-fitting black
clothes, who viewed the scene in frank bewilderment.
Silence fell on the room as the fellows
saw the visitors. Dr. Benedict smiled and held
up his hand.</p>

<p>“I must apologize for intruding on your ceremonies,
young gentlemen, but I have just received
some very good news and, as it interests
you quite as much as it does me, I have brought
the bearer of it to you and will ask him to deliver
his own message.”</p>

<p>The Doctor laid his hand on the arm of the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Boys, this is Mr. Finkler. Mr. Finkler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
these young gentlemen are the members of our
baseball team. And Mr. Shay, their coach.”</p>

<p>The boys greeted the introduction with a
subdued “<em>A-ay!</em>” of applause in which one
might have detected both surprise and curiosity.
Farmer Finkler bobbed his head, looking
very embarrassed, and cleared his throat.
Then he thrust a pair of big gnarled hands into
the pockets of his voluminous trousers and
seemed to find encouragement there.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” he began in his gruff voice,
“I ain’t got much to say. I didn’t expect to
make a speech when I came over here this
evening, but Dr. Benedict here seemed to
think I ought to. And maybe he’s right. Because
it gives me a chance to thank you all for
the help you gave me last night. I’m mighty
grateful. I guess I’d been a heap worse off
to-day than I be—am if it wasn’t for you boys.
I lost my stable and my barn, but those can be
built up again. I saved my horses, and that’s
the main thing. I—I’m fond o’ them horses;
guess horses is a sort of a weakness o’ mine,
boys. I ain’t saying anything about the value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of ’em; that’s considerable, too; but I’d just
plumb hated to lose them horses, boys. So, I—I’m
much obliged to you one and all. And—and
I guess I’ll just say good night and go
along home now.”</p>

<p>But the Doctor laid a detaining hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>“Just a minute, sir,” he laughed. “You’re
forgetting the main thing, aren’t you? About
the land?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, it’s just that I want to show
you that I’m grateful, boys,” said the farmer.
“You’ve been wanting a piece of my meadow
for a good while. Maybe I’ve been—been sort
o’ prejudiced against you.” There was a
twinkle in his eye and the boys grinned responsively.
“Well, we’ll let bygones be bygones.
The land’s yours, as much as you want
of it, two acres or five. The Doctor and I we
settled that part of it. It ain’t going to cost
you anything. You’re welcome to it, and I
hope it’ll make you a good playground.”</p>

<p>The cheer that went up was spontaneous and
so unexpected by Farmer Finkler that he fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
back from the doorway in alarm. The Doctor
laughingly reassured him. “They’re just showing
their appreciation of your generosity,” he
explained.</p>

<p>“I want to know!” ejaculated the farmer.</p>

<p>The boys were shoving Dolph forward with
cries of “Speech, Dolph, speech!” So Dolph,
a little embarrassed, accepted the office.</p>

<p>“Mr. Finkler,” he said earnestly, “I don’t
believe anything I can say will make you understand
how much we fellows appreciate what
you’ve done. Not only us few here, sir, but the
whole school—and the fellows who’ve gone and
those to come. It’s going to make a big difference,
sir, for it will give us an athletic field as
good as any in the country. We—we’re awfully
grateful to you, sir. It—it’s fine and
dandy of you! What we did to help last night
at the fire we were mighty glad to do, but
you’ve repaid us fifty times over, sir. And—and
I want to say—to promise on behalf of the
whole school, Mr. Finkler, that after this you
won’t have any trouble about your apples, sir!”</p>

<p>Laughter and applause greeted this remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Farmer Finkler’s wrinkled face relaxed.
“Well,” he drawled with that twinkle showing
again in his eye, “I guess that don’t matter
much. I guess a few apples ain’t anything between
friends.”</p>

<p>Dolph turned to Dr. Benedict. “And, Doctor,”
he resumed, “I’d like to suggest, sir,
that when the new field is finished we name it
after Mr. Finkler.”</p>

<p>A shout of approval went up and the Doctor
nodded smilingly.</p>

<p>“A good idea, Jones,” he agreed, “a very
good idea. We will call it Finkler’s Field.”</p>

“Double Play” and “Forward Pass!”; and we meet again the manly,
self-reliant Dan Vinton, his young friend Gerald Pennimore, and many
others of the “old boys” whose athletic achievements and other doings
have been so entertainingly chronicled by Mr. Barbour. The new story
is thus slightly connected with its predecessors, but will be fully as interesting
to a boy who has not read them as if it were not.</p>

Yardley Hall. He becomes in a way the mentor of the millionaire’s
son, Gerald Pennimore, who enters the school. There is the description

coach, Payson, puts some ginger into an overtrained squad and develops
from it a winning team will appeal to every boy.</p>

<p class="i2">In his new story, Mr. Barbour returns to the field of his earlier
and more successful stories, such as “The Half-Back,” “Captain of
the Crew,” etc. The main interest in “Forward Pass!” centers about
the “new” football; the story is, nevertheless, one of preparatory-school
life and adventures in general. The book contains several
illustrations and a number of diagrams of the “new” football plays.
Mr. Barbour considers this his best story.</p>

In his latest story, Mr. Hamilton takes up the life of upper classmen.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
